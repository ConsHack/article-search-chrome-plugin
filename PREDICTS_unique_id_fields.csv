to bees in south-east Asia are rare. Regeneration and restoration of the rapidly disappearing
lowland forests of this region are reliant on bees, thus there is an urgent need
for forest bee data at the community level.
2. Bee communities of eight forested sites in Johor (Malaysia) and Singapore were
surveyed three times each from February to August 1999 at the below-canopy level.
These sites ranged from relatively undisturbed primary lowland dipterocarp forests to
late secondary forests and exotic forests, including an oil palm plantation. We attempted
to elucidate the environmental factors that correlated with the distribution of bees.
3. Bee abundance, in particular that of Apidae, was significantly higher in larger
primary forests than other types of forests. However, bee species richness was higher in
disturbed forests.
4. The distribution of bees was apparently influenced by variables closely related to
forest disturbance and resource abundance, such as the density of big trees (diameter at
breast height 3040 cm), temperature and flowering intensity of trees and shrubs.
5. More stingless bees ( Trigona spp.) were found where trees were larger and ambient
conditions more constant but flowering intensities lower.
6. The differences between the bee communities in forests of urban Singapore and primary
forests in Johor may indicate that ecological processes in the forests of Singapore, in
particular pollination, may be changing. However, pollination may not be totally intact
in the primary forests surveyed, as their bee communities seemed to be depauperate.
7. The role of important pollinators, especially bees, for the long-term survival of tropical
lowland forests is poorly understood. Our study indicates that we urgently need more
thorough understanding of pollination and pollinators, as some bee species appear to
be disappearing from disturbed tropical lowland forests.","","","Adriana De Palma","afd10@imperial.ac.uk","Adriana De Palma",4,16,16,4

through grazing or mowing, but their species diversity is known to decline with increasing management intensity.
The reduction of management intensity can be a useful tool for the long-term conservation of the biological
diversity of grasslands. We analyzed floral and faunal diversity on intensively and extensively (unintensively)
grazed pastures and on 5- to 10-year-old ungrazed grasslands in northern Germany. Each of the
three grassland habitats differing in grazing intensity was replicated six times. We related diverse taxa such
as grasshoppers, butterfly adults and lepidopteran larvae, and trap-nesting solitary bees and wasps to vegetation
structure. There was an increase of species richness and abundance from pastures to ungrazed grasslands.
The percentage of parasitism of the most abundant trap-nesting species, the digger-wasp (
Trypoxylon
figulus
), was also higher on ungrazed grasslands. Decreased grazing on pastures enhanced species richness
for adult butterflies only, whereas the abundance of adult butterflies, solitary bees and wasps, and their natural
enemies increased. Although the differences in insect diversity between pastures and ungrazed grassland
could be attributed to a greater vegetation height and heterogeneity (bottom-up effects) on ungrazed areas,
the differences between intensively and extensively grazed pastures could not be explained by changes in vegetation
characteristics. Hence, intensive grazing appeared to affect the insect communities through the disruption
of plant-insect interactions. A mosaic of extensively grazed grassland and grassland left ungrazed for
a few years may be a good means by which to maintain biodiversity and the strength of trophic interactions.","","","Adriana De Palma","afd10@imperial.ac.uk","Adriana De Palma",3,52,1022,59

wildflowers, but many species have suffered dramatic declines in recent decades.
Strategies for their conservation require knowledge of their foraging range and nesting
density, both of which are poorly understood. Previous studies have mainly focussed on
the cosmopolitan bumblebee species Bombus terrestris, and implicitly assume this to be
representative of other species. Here we use a landscape-scale microsatellite study to
estimate the foraging range and nesting density of two ecologically dissimilar species,
B. terrestris and B. pascuorum. Workers were sampled along a 10 km linear transect
and 8 -9 polymorphic microsatellite markers used to identify putative sisters. We
provide the first published estimates of the number of colonies using a circle of radius
50 m in an agricultural landscape: 20.4 for B. terrestris and 54.7 for B. pascuorum.
Estimates of nest density differed significantly between the two species: 13 km
for B. terrestris and 193 km^2
for B. pascuorum. Foraging ranges also differed
substantially, with B. pascuorum foraging over distances less than 312 m and
B. terrestris less than 625 m. Clearly bumblebee species differ greatly in fundamental
aspects of their ecology. This has significant implications for the development of
conservation strategies for rare bumblebees and isolated plant populations, for the
management of bumblebees as pollinators, and for predicting patterns of gene flow
from genetically modified plants.","Fig 1 (p.472)","","Adriana De Palma","afd10@imperial.ac.uk","Adriana De Palma",1,17,51,3

crops. Orchards were chosen along a gradient of increasing distance from tropical rain forest (0.1Ð24
km). We sampled 100 ßowers from each of nine atemoya orchards and determined the identity and
abundance of insects within each ßower. To assess the amount of pollination due to insects, we bagged
six ßowers per tree and left another six ßowers per tree accessible to insects on 10 trees at an orchard
near rain forest. Results indicated that atemoya orchards0.5 km from rain forest were predominantly
visited by Þve previously unrecognized native beetle pollinators that are likely to originate in tropical
rain forest. These native beetles occurred reliably enough in crops near rain forest to have a positive
effect on the quantity of fruit produced but their contribution was not great enough to satisfy
commercial production needs. Management changes, aimed at increasing native beetle abundance in
crops, are required before these beetles could eliminate the need for growers to hand pollinate
atemoya ßowers. Appreciation of the value of this resource is necessary if we are to develop landscapes
that both conserve native biodiversity and support agricultural production.","","","Adriana De Palma","afd10@imperial.ac.uk","Adriana De Palma",1,9,90,10

The present two year study traced the ecological and seasonal patterns on 2 km2 of a southern slope in the Swiss Alps, ranging from 1150 to 1550 m above sea level. The study area consisted mainly of grassland under different regimes, mostly hay meadows and pastures. By direct netting at five monthly intervals in each year a total of 247 bee species were recorded. This comprehensive sampling scheme identified one of the most diverse bee faunas in Central and Northern Europe, consisting of a statistically estimated 280 species. Most species were rare with 14.6% represented by a single individual. Ecological analysis of the bee community showed that the primitively eusocial species were over represented among the abundant species and the parasitic species among the rarest. Both abundance and species richness were subject to marked seasonal variations. A substantial turnover in species composition as well as changes in ecological patterns were observed. More than 25% of all species were recorded in only one of the two years, in particular many of the parasitic species. Singletons accounted for a higher proportion when individual years rather than the pooled data were analysed.

at 23 of 25 farms in population densities that were commonly several times higher than that of other

great a density of squash bees as tilled farms. Pollinator density was not related to pesticide use. Honey
bee density on squash and pumpkin was not related to the presence of managed honey bee colonies
on farms. Farms with colonies did not have more honey bees per ßower than farms that did not keep
honey bees, probably reßecting the lack of afÞnity of honey bees for these crops. Future research
should examine the economic impacts of managing farms in ways that promote pollinators, particularly

Tropical rainforests are potential reservoirs of insects that could enhance crop pollination,
but only a few instances of the provision of such services by tropical rainforest
insects have been reported. Our field study aimed to determine the relative importance
of such insects to the pollination of macadamia
Macadamia integrifolia
and longan
Dimocarpus longan
crops on the Atherton Tableland, north Queensland, Australia.
2.
We quantified initial fruit set, a measure of pollination success, in treatments
designed to assess the relative importance of the possible modes of pollination. The
treatments were applied in orchards that varied in distance from rainforest, in order to
compare the effects of the contrasting pools of available pollen vectors. We also
recorded the insect species present and estimated the number of visits each made to
flowers in crops near and far from rainforest.
3.
For both crops there was an interaction between pollination treatment and distance from
rainforest. Maximum fruit set was only achieved when pollen vectors had access to flow
-
ers and orchards were close to rainforest. Exclusion of pollinators near rainforest reduced
initial fruit set to a greater extent than exclusion of pollinators far from rainforest.
4.
We confirmed that pollen transfer in macadamia is by autogamous self-pollination
and by pollen vectors, but our design did not distinguish among pollen vectors. The only
abundant insects in macadamia orchards were honeybees
Apis mellifera
. There were
more honeybee visits to macadamia flowers in orchards near rainforest than far from
rainforest, but we detected no relationship between honeybee visits and initial maca
-
damia fruit set in our sample of observations on a per raceme basis. More detailed
studies are needed to identify the pollen vector responsible for enhanced pollination of
macadamia near rainforest.
5.
We established for the first time that pollen transfer in longan is by a combination of
autogamous self-pollination, wind and bees. Longan flowers were visited by stingless
bees and honeybees but only stingless bees had a positive relationship with initial longan
fruit set and higher visitation rates near rainforest than far from rainforest. This
suggests that enhanced pollination in longan near rainforest resulted primarily from a
more abundant supply of stingless bees from the rainforest.
6.
Synthesis and applications.
By demonstrating that tropical rainforest can act as a re
-
servoir of pollen vectors that benefit crops, our study highlights the existence of a largely
unrecognized resource available to agriculture. At the same time our results make a significant
contribution to the growing database of studies that underscore the importance
of tropical rainforest conservation. Policy and management aimed at sustainable use of
this resource would satisfy the goals both of agriculturalists, to improve crop yields, and
conservationists, to conserve tropical rainforest.","","","Adriana De Palma","afd10@imperial.ac.uk","Adriana De Palma",1,11,264,24

a regional scale. A significantly negative effect of the number of trees on the occurrence of

species preference for open landscapes. Yet, apart from open landscapes additional landscape
features were shown to be important. A significantly positive effect of ditches in the final model
revealed the importance of this landscape element for the occurrence of B. muscorum. This finding
was additionally supported by recordings of nest-searching queens, nests, and flower visits along
dithes. The positive effects of clover and fallow land indicate the species need for suitable food
resources throughout the season. Because B. muscorum exhibits small foraging ranges, it is essential
that landscape elements that provide nesting sites, foraging habitats and undisturbed hibernation
structures are next to each other. The low numbers of individuals of B. muscorum recorded indicate
that the supply of these habitat elements may have reached a critical threshold in the study region.","Figure 1 (p.59)","","Adriana De Palma","afd10@imperial.ac.uk","Adriana De Palma",1,124,248,2

A total of 42 fields were investigated, half with at least 3-year-old margin strips created under the UK agri-environment scheme Countryside Stewardship and half nearby control sites. The sites were grouped on the basis of average field size into small, intermediate or open landscape locations to examine landscape structure effects. Assessments of the flora, bird and territory numbers, bees, spiders, Orthoptera and Carabidae were made in early to mid-summer 2003. There were positive impacts on diversity
or abundance for the flora, bees and Orthoptera. The herbaceous flora of the pre-existing boundary adjacent to sown 6 m strips was significantly more species-rich than controls, probably reflecting a buffer effect of the strip. Bees and Orthoptera, the latter of which were only found in field boundaries, were more abundant where strips were sited, reflecting added habitat resources. Bee numbers were significantly lower in field centres where there were no 6 m margin strips. There were no significant effects of sown strips on numbers of birds observed or bird territories, spiders or Carabidae, but also no negative impacts. Lycosid spiders were consistently more abundant in boundaries of small
fields with 6 m margin strips. Linyphiidae were more abundant within the crop area of smaller fields. Amongst birds, wrens (Troglodytes troglodytes) were also more abundant in small fields, while yellowhammers (Emberiza citrinella) were more abundant in open landscapes. The results confirm there are benefits to farmland biodiversity from introducing new margin strips at the edges of arable fields.

Bees are
dependent upon flowering plants for resources, and flowering plants often depend upon
bees for pollination services. Bees can therefore serve as indicator species of habitat degradation
due to these relationships with flowering plants. This study investigates how the
bumble bee community in San Francisco has responded to urbanization and which urban
park characteristics are important for the current communitys structure. To answer these
questions we sampled bumble bees, in 18 urban parks and two nearby wild parks. We estimated
park characteristics and used multiple regression analysis to determine which characteristics
predicted bumble bee abundance and species richness. Bumble bee abundance
was positively associated with resource availability or proxies of resource availability; natural
area (areas that contain remnant fragments that have been largely unchanged by
human activity) in 2003 and nest site abundance and openness of the surrounding matrix
in both 2003 and 2004. Bumble bee species richness was negatively associated with abundance
of a dominant species, Bombus vosnesenskii, in 2004. The importance of the surrounding
matrix suggests that these parks do not act as islands. Accordingly, area of park did not
explain species richness, while abundance of the dominant competitor did. The species
that was most influenced by competition, Bombus sitkensis, uses rodent holes as nest sites
and is possibly excluded from nest sites by the early emerging B. vosnesenskii, another subterranean
nester. The species least influenced by competition, Bombus melanopygus, is able
to use both rodent holes and abandoned bird nests as nest sites","Fig. 1 (p. 374), Methods p. 374-375","","Adriana De Palma","afd10@imperial.ac.uk","Adriana De Palma",2,40,200,10

GIS-based quantification of landscape structure (measured by proportions of seminatural
habitats and proportions of mass flowering crops) to get new insights into driving forces
of population dynamics of the bumblebee species

habitats was of minor importance. We used microsatellites to quantify landscape-related
colony densities, inbreeding and population substructure. Detected colony densities did
not correlate with landscape parameters or with local worker abundance, measured by

landscapes are rather due to greater colony sizes than due to an increased number of nests.
We found significant population substructure, measured by
FST and seven landscapesectors to bear significantly increased inbreeding values (FIS).FIS was strongly varyingbetween sectors but did not correlate with landscape structure. Moreover,FIS had asignificantly negative effect on colony size, demonstrating the importance of genetic
diversity on population fitness at a landscape scale. We suggest that inbreeding levels

habitats leaving only small and isolated habitat remnants within a homogeneous landscape matrix. 
Populations of fl owering plant species in these remaining habitat fragments are also declining and 
can not offer suffi cient resources for potential pollinators. The loss of pollinators and consequential 
pollination limitation is especially severe for obligately out-crossing plant species. In this study, pollination and reproductive success of Hippocrepis comosa was examined. Hippocrepis comosa L is a 
self-incompatible, declining plant species occurring on fragmented remnants in semi-natural calcareous 
grassland habitats in an agricultural landscape in Southern Lower Saxony, Germany. Plant-pollinator 
interactions were analysed in small, medium, and large plant patches in 15 differently sized calcareous 
grassland fragments surrounded by landscape matrices of differing complexity. Flower visitors were 
observed during three 15-minute observations, pollen supplementation experiments were performed 
to test for pollination limitation, and fruits from the plant patches were collected to calculate seed 
set. Hippocrepis comosa showed evidence of pollination limitation because hand-pollinated fl owers 
set more seeds per infl orescence than open-pollinated fl owers and seed set was strongly reduced by 
decreased visitation rates. Pollinators were most abundant in large patches and in diverse landscapes. 
Visitation rate was not affected by patch size. Hence, in order to maintain plant-pollinator interactions in an agricultural landscape, conservation efforts should include the preservation of calcareous 
grasslands that can support suffi ciently large patches of a plant species and offer ample rewards for 
pollinators and the establishment of a diverse agricultural landscape around the semi-natural habitats

In intensively farmed agricultural landscapes, many species are confined to very
small uncultivated areas such as field margins. However, it has been suggested that these
small habitat elements cannot support viable populations of all the species observed
there. Instead, species richness and abundance in these small habitat fragments may, at
least partly, be dependent on dispersal from larger semi-natural grassland fragments.
2.
We tested this hypothesis for butterflies and bumble bees in 12 independent landscapes
in a region of intense agriculture in southern Sweden. In each landscape we surveyed
abundance and species richness in one semi-natural grassland, one linear habitat
(uncultivated field margin) adjacent to this (called proximate) and one similar linear
habitat (called distant) situated at least 1000 m from the semi-natural grassland patch.
3.
Both species richness and density (individuals per unit area) of butterflies and bumble
bees were significantly higher in proximate linear habitats than in distant ones. Moreover,
butterfly species richness was higher for a given area in grasslands than in any of the
linear habitat types. Butterfly density in grasslands did not differ from that in proximate
linear habitats but was lower in distant linear habitats. The effect of isolation on density
was stronger for less mobile butterfly species. For bumble bees there was no difference
in species richness between grasslands and proximate linear habitats.
4.
For at least some of the butterfly species even these relatively small fragments of
semi-natural grasslands act as population sources from which individuals disperse to
the surrounding habitats and thereby contribute to higher densities and species richness
in adjacent areas. For bumble bees, it is more likely that the grasslands contain a higher
density of nests than the surrounding intensively cultivated landscape, and that the
density of foraging bumble bees decreases with increasing distance from the nest.
5.
 Habitat fragmentation and intensified agricultural
practices are considered to be a threat against services provided by pollinators. In order
to sustain the abundance and diversity of insect pollinators in intensively farmed
agricultural landscapes, we suggest that preservation of the remaining semi-natural
grasslands or re-creation of flower-rich grasslands is essential.

ecosystems because protected areas constitute a small fraction of the Earths surface and because
anthropogenic habitats may offer more opportunities for conservation than has been previously thought. We
investigated how an important functional group, pollinators (bees; Hymenoptera: Apiformes), are affected by
human land use at the landscape and local scales in southern New Jersey (U.S.A.). We established 40 sites
that differed in surrounding landscape cover or local habitat type and collected 2551 bees of 130 species. The
natural habitat in this ecosystem is a forested, ericaceous heath. Bee abundance and species richness within
forest habitat decreased, not increased, with increasing forest cover in the surrounding landscape. Similarly,
bee abundance was greater in agricultural fields and suburban and urban developments than in extensive
forests, and the same trend was found for species richness. Particular species groups that might be expected
to show greater sensitivity to habitat loss, such as floral specialists and bees of small or large body size, did
not show strong positive associations with forest habitat. Nevertheless, 18 of the 130 bee species studied were
positively associated with extensive forest. One of these species is a narrow endemic that was last seen in 1939.
Our results suggest that at least in this system, moderate anthropogenic land use may be compatible with the
conservation of many, but not all, bee species.","Methods p.214-215","","Adriana De Palma","afd10@imperial.ac.uk","Adriana De Palma",2,80,80,2

In many European agricultural landscapes, species richness is declining considerably. Studies
performed at a very large spatial scale are helpful in understanding the reasons for this decline and
as a basis for guiding policy. In a unique, large-scale study of 25 agricultural landscapes in seven
European countries, we investigated relationships between species richness in several taxa, and the
links between biodiversity and landscape structure and management.
2.
We estimated the total species richness of vascular plants, birds and five arthropod groups in
each 16-km
2
landscape, and recorded various measures of both landscape structure and intensity
of agricultural land use. We studied correlations between taxonomic groups and the effects of
landscape and land-use parameters on the number of species in different taxonomic groups. Our
statistical approach also accounted for regional variation in species richness unrelated to landscape
or land-use factors.
3.
The results reveal strong geographical trends in species richness in all taxonomic groups. No
single species group emerged as a good predictor of all other species groups. Species richness of all
groups increased with the area of semi-natural habitats in the landscape. Species richness of birds
and vascular plants was negatively associated with fertilizer use.
4.
Synthesis and applications.
We conclude that indicator taxa are unlikely to provide an effective
means of predicting biodiversity at a large spatial scale, especially where there is large biogeographical
variation in species richness. However, a small list of landscape and land-use parameters can be used
in agricultural landscapes to infer large-scale patterns of species richness. Our results suggest that
to halt the loss of biodiversity in these landscapes, it is important to preserve and, if possible,
increase the area of semi-natural habitat.","","","Adriana De Palma","afd10@imperial.ac.uk","Adriana De Palma",21,1257,146706,2469

AD1 22/11/2013 Updated permissions, study target, taxon status, site area and fragmentation layout","During recent decades, concern about the loss of biodiversity on agricultural land has increased, and semi-natural
grasslands have been highlighted as critical habitats. Temperate European agricultural landscapes require distinct and
appropriate management to prevent further impoverishment of the flora and fauna. This is especially urgent for
pollinating insects that provide important ecosystem services. Our aim was to examine how species richness of three
important groups of pollinating insects; solitary bees, butterflies and burnet moths are related to different farm
characteristics, and if there are any differences between these three groups. A further aim was to test if red-listed species
are related to any farm characteristics. Species richness of solitary bees, butterflies and burnets was measured on all seminatural grasslands at 16 farms in a forest-dominated area of 50 km^2 in southern Sweden, using systematic transect walks in April to September 2003 (only butterflies and burnets) and 2005. Species richness of solitary bees and butterflies was intercorrelated, both before and after controlling for the area of semi-natural grassland. Species richness of solitary bees
increased with the area of semi-natural grassland. After controlling for the effect of the area of semi-natural grassland
species richness was strongly positively related with the density of the plant Knautia arvensis and negatively related with
the proportion of grazed grassland. The results were similar for solitary bees and butterflies. The number of red-listed
solitary bees was positively related to the proportion of meadows with late harvest (after mid-July) and decreased with
increased farm isolation. The number of burnet species (all red-listed) was positively related to vegetation height, flower
density and the proportion of meadows with late harvest on a farm. Areas with a high density of K. arvensis and with
traditional hay-meadow with late harvest present, harbour most species. Promoting traditional hay-meadows, late
extensive grazing and the herb K. arvensis, people managing agricultural biodiversity can encompass high species richness
of pollinating insects and support red-listed species. Further, we suggest that the density of K. arvensis at a farm can be
used as a biodiversity indicator, at least for pollinating insects.","Methods (p.699), Fig. 2 (p.700)","","Adriana De Palma","afd10@imperial.ac.uk","Adriana De Palma",1,16,2016,126

AD1 21/05/2014 Altered habitat type according to altitude (sites below 600m tend to be agriculture, sites above tend to be pasture).","Factors that determine the relative abundance of bumblebee species remain
poorly understood, rendering management of rare and declining species difficult. Studies of
bumblebee communities in the Americas suggest that there are strong competitive interactions
between species with similar length tongues, and that this competition determines
the relative abundance of species. In contrast, in Europe it is common to observe several
short-tongued species coexisting with little or no evidence for competition shaping community
structure. In this study we examine patterns of abundance and distribution in one of
the most diverse bumblebee communities in Europe, found in the mountains of southern
Poland. We quantify forage use when collecting nectar and pollen for 23 bumblebee
species, and examine patterns of co-occurrence and niche overlap to determine whether
there is evidence for inter-specific competition. We also test whether rarity can be
explained by diet breadth. Up to 16 species were found coexisting within single sites, with
species richness peaking in mountain pasture at *1,000 m altitude. Results concur with
previous studies indicating that the majority of pollen collected by bumblebees is from
Fabaceae, but that some bee species (e.g. B. ruderatus) are much more heavily dependent
on Fabaceae than others (e.g. B. lucorum). Those species that forage primarily on Fabaceae
tended to have long tongues. In common with studies in the UK, diet breadth was correlated
with abundance: rarer species tended to visit fewer flower species, after correcting
for differences in sample size. No evidence was found for similarity in tongue length or
dietary overlap influencing the likelihood of co-occurrence of species. However, the most
abundant species (which co-occurred at most sites) occupied distinct dietary niche space.
While species with tongues of similar length tended, overall, to have higher dietary niche
overlap, among the group of abundant short-tongued species that commonly co-occurred
there was marked dietary differentiation which may explain their coexistence.","p.3271 and Appendix 1 (p. 3283)","","Adriana De Palma","afd10@imperial.ac.uk","Adriana De Palma",1,32,704,22

to enhance biodiversity, such as agri-environment schemes, often have little effect, especially in
intensively farmed landscapes. The effectiveness of conservation management may be improved by
scheme implementation near high-quality habitats that can act as a source of species. We evaluated
up to what distance high-quality habitats (nature reserves and artificially created flower-rich patches)
fect the diversity of forbs and pollinators in intensively farmed landscapes of the Netherlands.
We surveyed forbs, inflorescences, bees and hover flies and estimated pollination services in
ansects along ditch banks extending 300 m from four nature reserves forming small islands in
landscapes dominated by agriculture.
In a separate experiment, we surveyed inflorescences, bees and hover flies in 1500 m long transects
on farmland adjacent to five newly introduced flower-rich patches and in five control transects.
Species density of forbs declined over the first 75 m and species density and abundance of hover
flies declined over the first 125 m beyond the nature reserves. Beyond these distances, no further
declines were observed. The effects of flower-rich patches were spatially limited. The species density
and abundance of bees and hover flies were significantly enhanced in the flower-rich patch, but only
the abundance of hover flies was enhanced up to 50 m beyond the patch.
 In intensively farmed areas, remnant high-quality habitats sustain more
undant and diverse pollinator and forb communities than the surrounding countryside. They do
enhance biodiversity on nearby farmland but increases are spatially restricted (< 150 m) and relatively
small. These habitats may therefore function only as dispersal sources for ecological restoration sites or
gricultural fields under extensification schemes that are located in close proximity. Habitat restoration
in intensivelyused farmlandshould thereforebe implemented preferentiallyin the immediate vicinity of
high-quality habitats. In the short term, newly created flower-rich habitats are no alternative
to pre-existing seminatural habitats for the promotion of pollinators on nearby farmland.

native tallgrass prairie fragments and nearby ruderal areas (within 2.1 km) in Iowa, USA in the summer of 2004. Bee communities in ruderal
areas were significantly less diverse than those in native tallgrass prairie remnants, with about half as many species and approximately a third
as many bees. Diversity, abundance, and richness of floral resources were also significantly less in ruderal grasslands than in native prairies,
indicating that poor floral resource levels may substantially depauperate their bee communities. Common bees dominated the composition of
the ruderal grasslands; only one rare species in this study was found at a ruderal site, indicating that high-quality prairie remnants are
important reservoirs of bee diversity. Abundance of flowering ramets of a plant species was a significant predictor of the abundance of bees
found on that plant. There was also a preference for human-yellow flowers after adjusting for ramet abundance and there were significantly
more bees caught in yellow pan traps than blue or white ones. The abundance, but not the richness, of small bee species (length  7.5 mm) was
less than expected at ruderal sites when compared to prairies, implying the presence of local nesting opportunities in ruderal grasslands for
small bees but insufficient resources to support large populations.","p.201","","Adriana De Palma","afd10@imperial.ac.uk","Adriana De Palma",2,18,657,73

interest in the current and potential role of wild pollinators in agricultural pollination. Pumpkin
(Cucurbita pepo L.) has great potential to be served by wild pollinators because of a reliable and
widespread group of bee species that are commonly associated with their ßowers, including bumble
bees (Bombus spp.), and, in the Americas, two genera of specialist ground nesting bees (Peponapis and
Xenoglossa). We examined the effects of several key farm management practices and landscape
variables on bee abundance in pumpkin on 20 farms in Virginia and Maryland during summer 2006.
Weevaluated bee abundance with respect to tillage, irrigation practices, soil properties, natural habitat
(forest and grassland), ßowering crop, and disturbed areas. Additionally, we examined nest site
preference (within or outside of crop areas) of Peponapis pruinosa (Say) at one farm and in a large
screenhouse. We found P. pruinosa nesting preferentially within crop areas and near the vines and
leaves of their host plant. Although these bees typically place some of their brood cells within tillage
depth, we did not Þnd a tillage effect on their abundance at ßowers. We found a negative effect of
soil clay content (R2  0.24, P  0.03) and a positive effect of irrigation (F1, 15  12.2; P  0.001) on

requires a landscape-scale approach since the geographic scale at which most non-farmed
species operate is unconstrained by farm boundaries. Bumblebees are a key component
of farmland biodiversity as pollinators of both crops and wild flora. However, the factors
determining their densities in such landscapes remain poorly understood.
2. Using a combination of remote-sensed landscape data and molecular markers, we
quantify the effects of land use (oilseed rape, field beans and non-cropped areas, all of
which provide suitable bumblebee forage), at various spatial scales to find the best
predictor of colony density for the bumblebee Bombus pascuorum Scopoli in an arable
landscape.
3. Estimated colony density was positively correlated with the area of all habitat
categories within 1000 m of the sample site. No significant relationships were found for
greater or lesser distances. This concurs with earlier estimates of the foraging range of
this species. We found no evidence that nest sizes increased with forage availability,
although our data do not allow us to categorically exclude this possibility.
4. It has long been suspected that forage availability limits bee abundance in agricultural
landscapes but there is little direct evidence for this. Here we report a direct relationship
between floral abundance and bumblebee nest density within a notionally fixed area.
Importantly, we suggest that the forage availability within the previously published
estimated foraging distance for this species at this location is a good predictor of the scale
of impact of forage provision on nesting density.

agroecosystems depends on several factors, including the land management systems used by farmers.
Here we focused on the effects of insect pollinator diversity on coffee fruit production along a gradient of
management systems in central Veracruz, Mexico. The gradient ranged from low environmental impact
management systems (the native forest is not completely removed) to high environmental impact
management systems (the native forest is completely removed). We hypothesized that pollinator
diversity should be higher in low-impact systems. Then, if fruit production is positively related to
pollinator diversity, plantations with low-impact management systems should display higher fruit
production than plantations with high-impact management systems. We used observational and
experimental data to test this hypothesis. Our results indicated that low-impact management systems
have higher species richness and relative diversity (measured with the Shannon-Wiener diversity index)
of pollinators than high-impactmanagement systems. In all cases, fruit production was positively related
with species richness and diversity of pollinators. Moreover, fruit production was higher in low-impact
than in high-impact management systems. These results suggest that the diversity of insect pollinators
can be influenced by the management system applied by farmers, and that such effects may have strong
consequences on coffee fruit production.","p.118","","Adriana De Palma","afd10@imperial.ac.uk","Adriana De Palma",1,16,240,15

managed farmland and the agricultural landscape at large. We tested whether this goal can be
achieved in the case of the agri-environmental restoration scheme implemented for Swiss grassland
using five large arthropod taxa (bees, true bugs, orthopterans, ground beetles and spiders) representing
different ecological and functional groups. The species richness and abundance of all groups and species,
respectively, was measured along 100 m transects from ECA-meadows into the adjacent intensively managed
grassland at 24 sites. Species richness of all arthropod taxa except ground beetles, and the abundance
of 63% of the 234 arthropod species sampled with at least five individuals were higher in ECAmeadows
than in their surroundings, while the total abundance of spiders and ground beetles was higher
in intensively managed meadows. The abundance of 8% of these species were only increased in the ECAmeadows
themselves (stenotopic species) but 40% had increased abundance both in the ECA-meadows
and the adjacent grassland, declining exponentially with increasing distance from ECA-meadows (edge

for true bugs, 137 ± 24 m for spiders, 152 ± 34 m for bees, 167 ± 5.7 m for orthopterans, 185 ± 34 m for
ground beetles; mean ±1 standard error) and independent of taxonomic group were larger for large-sized
or predacious species than for small-sized or phytophagous species. Because the average distance
between neighbouring ECA-meadows in Swiss grassland is only 73 ± 4 m, the current agri-environment

pollinating insects. Genetic studies provide insights into population structure that are
crucial for conservation management but that would be impossible to obtain by
conventional ecological methods. Yet conservation genetic studies of bees have primarily
focussed on social species rather than the more species-rich solitary bees. Here, we
investigate the population structure of Colletes floralis, a rare and threatened solitary
mining bee, in Ireland and Scotland using nine microsatellite loci. Genetic diversity was
surprisingly as high in Scottish (Hebridean island) populations at the extreme
northwestern edge of the species range as in mainland Irish populations further south.
Extremely high genetic differentiation among populations was detected; multilocus FST
was up to 0.53, and G0
ST and Dest were even higher (maximum: 0.85 and 1.00, respectively).
A pattern of isolation by distance was evident for sites separated by land. Water appears
to act as a substantial barrier to gene flow yet sites separated by sea did not exhibit
isolation by distance. C. floralis populations are extremely isolated and probably not in
regional migration-drift equilibrium. GIS-based landscape genetic analysis reveals
urban areas as a potential and substantial barrier to gene flow. Our results highlight the
need for urgent site-specific management action to halt the decline of this and potentially
other rare solitary bees.","Table 1 (p.4925)","","Adriana De Palma","afd10@imperial.ac.uk","Adriana De Palma",1,12,12,1

over time. Here for the ﬁrst time we use molecular markers to estimate within-season changes in the
numbers of nests.
2. Workers of two bumblebee species were sampled in an arable landscape in late May–June and
late July–August, and the numbers of nests represented in each sample were estimated. We compare
the methods available to estimate nest number from such samples and conclude that methods which
allow for heterogeneity in the probability of capture of nests provide the best ﬁt to our data.
Changes in numbers of nests at the two time points were used to infer nest survival.
3. The two bee species appeared to diﬀer markedly in survival over time, with estimates of 45%of
nests surviving for Bombus lapidarius and 91% for B. pascuorum. However, our data suggest that
the foraging range of B. pascuorum may be greater in late season, which would lead us to overestimate
nest survival in this species. Diﬀerential survival may also reﬂect diﬀerences in phenology
between the two species.
4. The land use class which had the most consistent eﬀects on nest number and survival was gardens;
for B. lapidarius, the area of gardens within a 750 and 1000 mradius positively inﬂuenced nest
survival, while for B. pascuorum, the number of nests in late samples was higher at sites with more
gardens within a 500 and 750-m radius. For B. pascuorum, the area of grassland within a 250 and
500-mradius also positively inﬂuenced nest number in late samples, probably because this is the preferred
nesting habitat for this species.
5. The importance of gardens is in accordance with previous studies which suggest that they now
provide a stronghold for bumblebees in an otherwise impoverished agricultural environment; furthermore,
our data suggest that the positive inﬂuence of gardens on bumblebee populations can spill
over at least 1 km into surrounding farmland.
6. Synthesis and applications. The substantial eﬀects that even small areas of local resources such
as rough grassland or clover leys can have on bumblebee nest numbers and survival is of clear
relevance for the design of pollinator management strategies.","Table 2 and 3 (p. 1211) and supplementary material Figure S1.","","Adriana De Palma","afd10@imperial.ac.uk","Adriana De Palma",1,14,28,2

small-scale disturbance on local richness, abundance, diversity and evenness of insect
pollinator fauna; and how habitat disturbance affected species turnover across the landscape
and overall diversity along a precipitation gradient in NW Patagonia (Argentina).
We evaluated the effect of disturbance on overall pollinator fauna and then separately for
bees (i.e. Apoidea) and non-bee pollinators. Locally, disturbed habitats had significantly
higher pollinator species richness and abundances than undisturbed habitats for the whole
pollinator assemblage, but not for bees or non-bees separately. However, significant differences
in species richness between habitats vanished after accounting for differences in
abundance between habitat types. At a local scale ShannonWeaver diversity and evenness
did not vary with disturbance. A b diversity index indicated that, across forest types,
species turnover was lower between disturbed habitats than between undisturbed habitats.
In addition, rarefaction curves showed that disturbed habitats as a whole accumulated
fewer species than undisturbed habitats at equivalent sample sizes. We concluded that
small patches of disturbed habitat have a negligible effect on local pollinator diversity;
however, habitat disturbance reduced b diversity through a homogenization of the pollinator
fauna (in particular of bees) across the landscape.","p.260","","Adriana De Palma","afd10@imperial.ac.uk","Adriana De Palma",1,4,208,52

The predominant form of agricultural land management in this region is
crofting, a system specific to Scotland in which small agricultural units (crofts) operate rotational cropping and grazing regimes. Crofting is considered to be beneficial to a wide range of flora and fauna. However, currently there is a lack of quantitative evidence to support this view with regard to bumblebee
populations. In this study we assessed the effect of land management on the abundance of foraging bumblebees and the availability of bumblebee forage plants across crofts in northwest Scotland. The results of
our study show that current crofting practices do not support high densities of foraging bumblebees. Traditional crofting practice was to move livestock to uplands in the summer, but this has been largely abandoned. Summer sheep grazing of lowland pasture had a strong negative impact on bumblebee abundance
and forage plant availability throughout the survey period. The use of specific bird and bee conservation
seed mixes appears to improve forage availability within the crofted landscape, although the number of
bees observed remained low. Of the forage plants available, the three most frequently visited species
were from the Fabaceae. We therefore conclude that the creation of agri-environment schemes which
promote the use of Fabaceae-rich seed mixes and encourage the removal of sheep grazing on lowland
areas throughout the summer are essential in order to conserve bumblebee populations within crofted
areas.","","","Adriana De Palma","afd10@imperial.ac.uk","Adriana De Palma",1,11,77,7

cause for considerable concern. Habitat degradation, destruction and fragmentation due to agricultural intensification have
historically been the main causes of this pollinator decline. However, despite increasing and accelerating levels of global
urbanization, very little research has investigated the effects of urbanization on pollinator assemblages. We assessed
changes in the diversity, abundance and species composition of bee and hoverfly pollinator assemblages in urban,
suburban, and rural sites across a UK city.
Methodology/Principal Findings: Bees and hoverflies were trapped and netted at 24 sites of similar habitat character
(churchyards and cemeteries) that varied in position along a gradient of urbanization. Local habitat quality (altitude, shelter
from wind, diversity and abundance of flowers), and the broader-scale degree of urbanization (e.g. percentage of built
landscape and gardens within 100 m, 250 m, 500 m, 1 km, and 2.5 km of the site) were assessed for each study site. The
diversity and abundance of pollinators were both significantly negatively associated with higher levels of urbanization.
Assemblage composition changed along the urbanization gradient with some species positively associated with urban and
suburban land-use, but more species negatively so. Pollinator assemblages were positively affected by good site habitat
quality, in particular the availability of flowering plants.
Conclusions/Significance: Our results show that urban areas can support diverse pollinator assemblages, but that this
capacity is strongly affected by local habitat quality. Nonetheless, in both urban and suburban areas of the city the
assemblages had fewer individuals and lower diversity than similar rural habitats. The unique development histories of
different urban areas, and the difficulty of assessing mobile pollinator assemblages in just part of their range, mean that
complementary studies in different cities and urban habitats are required to discover if these findings are more widely
applicable.","Materials and Methods p.6","","Adriana De Palma","afd10@imperial.ac.uk","Adriana De Palma",1,24,2592,108

87%, some within the last 20 y. We also show that declining populations
have significantly higher infection levels of the microsporidian
pathogen Nosemabombi and lower genetic diversity compared
with co-occurring populations of the stable (nondeclining) species.
Higher pathogen prevalence and reduced genetic diversity are, thus,
realistic predictors of these alarming patterns of decline in North
America, although cause and effect remain uncertain.","Supplementary material 1 Methods and Supplementary table 1","","Adriana De Palma","afd10@imperial.ac.uk","Adriana De Palma",2,382,3438,18

Substantial reductions in the distributional ranges of several species of
bumblebee have been recorded in the UK. Loss and fragmentation of suitable foraging
and nesting habitat to agricultural intensification is thought to be the main driving
force behind declines.
2. Limited knowledge of species ecology means that effective conservation management
prescriptions cannot be put into place.
3. Here we investigated the spatial dynamics of two UK Biodiversity Action Plan
bumblebee species, Bombus sylvarum and Bombus humilis. For the first time, microsatellite
DNA analysis was used to estimate foraging distances in rare bumblebees.
4. Sisterhoods were identified between bees sampled at discrete forage patches
within a fragmented landscape. Using these sisterhoods, minimum estimates of maximum
and mean foraging distances were calculated from distances separating sister
bees.
5. Minimum mean foraging distances were calculated as 475  97 m for B. humilis
and 231  58 m for B. sylvarum. Mean distances were significantly greater for
B. humilis than B. sylvarum (P < 0.001).
6. The differences between the spatial scales that the species were recorded over
highlighted a need for further research into the spatial dynamics of rare and more
ubiquitous foraging bumblebees.

MFCs infl uences pollinator visits to assemblages of adjacent native, non-crop plant species (pollinator  spill-over  ). In
this study we quantifi ed bumblebee abundance along hedgerow transects in MFC (fi eld bean) vs non-MFC (wheat)
margins. Surveys were conducted on east and west-facing margins twice daily (morning and afternoon) for three or four
days during the main MFC fl owering period (June) over four years involving paired bean and wheat fi elds in Devon and
Cornwall, southwest England. Although no single bumblebee species showed any consistent change in relative frequency,
when taken across all years and bumblebee species combined, we observed twice as many bumblebees visiting fl owers
adjacent to the MFC. However, when we compared bumblebee activity along hedgerow transects two weeks after bean
fl owering, there was no diff erence between crops. We thus conclude that although there is evidence for pollinator spillover
from the bean MFC to nearby semi-natural habitat, the eff ect is comparatively short lived and not specifi c to any
single bumblebee species. We also suggest that while pollinator services to native plant species might be briefl y enhanced
by MFC cultivation, the possible repercussions of bumblebee spill-over from MFCs to semi-natural habitats and the
other pollinator groups they support should be evaluated before MFC cultivation is considered as a means of conserving

cause indirect cross-habitat effects on conservation areas. We conducted three landscape-scale field
studies on 67 sites to test the hypothesis that mass flowering of oilseed rape (Brassica napus) results in
a transient dilution of bees in crop fields, and in increased competition between crop plants and grassland
plants for pollinators. Abundances of bumble-bees, which are the main pollinators of the grassland plant
Primula veris, but also pollinate oilseed rape (OSR), decreased with increasing amount of OSR. This
landscape-scale dilution affected bumble-bee abundances strongly in OSR fields and marginally in grasslands,
where bumble-bee abundances were generally low at the time of Primula flowering. Seed set of
Primula veris, which flowers during OSR bloom, was reduced by 20 per cent when the amount of
OSR within 1 km radius increased from 0 to 15 per cent. Hence, the current expansion of bee-attractive
biofuel crops results in transient dilution of crop pollinators, which means an increased competition for
pollinators between crops and wild plants. In conclusion, mass-flowering crops potentially threaten fitness
of concurrently flowering wild plants in conservation areas, despite the fact that, in the long run,
mass-flowering crops can enhance abundances of generalist pollinators and their pollination service.","Methods (p.3445-3446).","","Adriana De Palma","afd10@imperial.ac.uk","Adriana De Palma",2,134,335,5

They are crucial for reproductive success in many angiosperms but are threatened by intensive agricultural
practices. Although less intensive approaches, including organic farming, could improve
farmland biodiversity, it is not clear whether or not these approaches enhance wild plant pollination
and the stability of insectflower interaction networks.
2. We investigated the effects of organic vs. conventional farming on insectflower interaction network
size and structure, bee and hoverfly diversity, and pollination in 10 pairs of organic and conventional
dairy farms in the Republic of Ireland.
3. We found that insectflower interaction networks on organic farms were larger and more asymmetrically
structured than networks on conventional farms. Overall, however, networks contained
fewer taxa and niche overlap and plant  animal ratios were relatively low compared with previously
documented insectflower interaction networks. Organic farms did attract higher numbers of bees
partly because of higher floral abundances (mainly Trifolium sp.). Hoverfly evenness was greater in
organic farms but neither abundance, richness nor evenness was related to floral abundance, suggesting
organic farms provide additional resources for hoverflies. Pollination of Crataegus monogyna
hawthorn was higher on organic farms, although pollen deposition was limited.
4. Synthesis and applications. Organic dairy farming can increase the size and alter the structure of
insectflower interaction networks. However, network stability was not improved and all networks
(organic and conventional) were vulnerable because of their small size, low niche overlap and low
plant  animal ratios. Nonetheless, organic farming provided more flowers that attracted more
flower visitors and improved pollination of C. monogyna. We suggest that strategic management of
important flowers for pollinators in hedgerows and pastures should be endorsed in agri-environmental
schemes. Sowing Trifolium spp., and allowing these plants to flower, could benefit bees, but
more research into hoverfly ecology is necessary before realistic conservation recommendations can
be made for this group. We conclude that organic farming, although not the solution in its present
form, can benefit insect biodiversity, insectflower interaction networks and insect-mediated pollination.","Methods p.562","","Adriana De Palma","afd10@imperial.ac.uk","Adriana De Palma",2,40,1460,73

Each survey yielded a separate interaction network, comprising all flower visitors found during 6 h in an area of 1000m2.
In total we recorded 105 plant species and 586 flower visitor species. Species composition of plants and flower visitors
differed considerably between the two management regimes, with species overlaps of 43% in plants and 42% in flower visitors.
Complementary specialisation of flower visitors differed between taxa: dipterans were significantly less specialised than beetles
and butterflies, and bees had the highest degree of specialisation. Earlier in the season (before mowing), meadows of lowintensity
land use were significantly richer in flowering plant, bee and butterfly species. They also showed more plantflower
visitor interactions, greater flowering areas and higher individual numbers of butterflies than meadows of high-intensity land
use. However, later in the season (after mowing) management types differed only in plant species richness, being higher on
meadows of low-intensity land use.
We conclude that variations in plant species composition resulting from differences in grassland management may alter
plantflower visitor interactions. Moreover, an impoverishment of flower diversity has stronger effects on the diversity and
species composition of specialised flower visitor groups than on little or unspecialised flower visitors.","","","Adriana De Palma","afd10@imperial.ac.uk","Adriana De Palma",2,58,18096,624

of economically important crops. However, there is some inconsistency in the literature as to how these
communities should best be managed. To address this issue, we collected bees from an intensively managed
agricultural region in eastern Australia using blue vane traps. Both linear remnants of vegetation,
which form part of a larger corridor network, and adjacent fields of native and exotic pastures, wheat,
canola, and lucerne were sampled. A total of 3249 individual bees, representing four families and 36 species
were collected. Highly modified environments of nectar-bearing crop supported the most speciesrich
bee assemblages, and the highest abundance of individual bee species. Distance from the remnants
did not limit the body size of species occupying fields (up to 400 m). However, richness of bee assemblages
also responded positively to the presence of conservation land in nearby areas, or the number
of remnant native trees surrounding traps. Linear remnants of native vegetation contributed to assemblage
heterogeneity by adding unique species to the regional pool. Our findings indicate that agricultural
industries that currently rely on pollination by A. mellifera should ensure that intensive land use is complemented
by untilled areas in the form of conservation land, or farm dams and scattered trees in fields,
to support wild pollinators that may act as insurance against further future losses of managed hives.","","Lentini et al 2012.pdf","Adriana De Palma","afd10@imperial.ac.uk","Adriana De Palma",1,104,3744,36

important to understand the way they move in agricultural landscapes if we are to conserve them and benefit from
their activity as pollinators.We surveyed bees using directional flight interception (Malaise) traps over a 1-year
period in two agricultural landscapes in south-east Queensland, Australia.We placed traps at the ecotone between
crops and remnant vegetation to establish the pattern of movement between these habitats. Species richness in these
landscapes (70) was high relative to that in comparable studies. Some bees were active year round, but most were
caught in the period September to March. Across the whole assemblage there was a significant pattern where more
species were detected leaving rather than entering remnant vegetation. The same bias was true for the number of
individuals of the two most abundant species (Homalictus urbanus and Apis mellifera). Species exclusively found in
crops were smaller on average (and therefore have smaller foraging range) than their non-crop counterparts.
Together, these patterns indicate that while bees are abundant in crop habitat, the remnant vegetation is important
as the point of origin for bee movements, and the riparian remnant in particular is richer than the dry native
remnant. Compositional similarity among samples was significantly explained by landscape but also movement
direction (i.e. to or from the riparian remnant) because different species showed different patterns of response.The

separate effects of these two drivers on plantpollinator

still lack an understanding of combined and potential interactive
effects. In a subtropical south african landscape, we
studied 17 plantpollinator networks along two gradients
of relative abundance of exotics and land-use intensity. In
general, pollinator visitation rates were lower on exotic
plants than on native ones. surprisingly, while visitation
rates on native plants increased with relative abundance
of exotics and land-use intensity, pollinator visitation on
exotic plants decreased along the same gradients. there
was a decrease in the specialization of plants on pollinators
and vice versa with both drivers, regardless of plant origin.
Decreases in pollinator specialization thereby seemed
to be mediated by a species turnover towards habitat generalists.
however, contrary to expectations, we detected
no interactive effects between the two drivers. Our results
suggest that exotic plants and land-use promote generalist
plants and pollinators, while negatively affecting specialized
plantpollinator interactions. Weak integration and
high specialization of exotic plants may have prevented
interactive effects between exotic plants and land-use. still,
the additive effects of exotic plants and land-use on specialized
plantpollinator interactions would have been overlooked
in a single-factor study. We therefore highlight the
need to consider multiple drivers of global change in ecological
research and conservation management.","","","Adriana De Palma","afd10@imperial.ac.uk","Adriana De Palma",2,34,3502,206

important objective of many conservation studies. We evaluated the impacts of a wide gradient of disturbance
in Gabon on a range of arthropod assemblages representing different feeding guilds. We examined 4 × 105
arthropod individuals from which 21 focal taxa were separated into 1534 morphospecies. Replication included
the understory of 3 sites in each of 4 different stages of forest succession and land use (i.e., habitats) after
logging (old and young forests, savanna, and gardens). We used 3 complementary sampling methods to survey
sites throughout the year. Overall differences in arthropod abundance and diversity were greatest between
forest and open habitats, and cleared forest invaded by savanna had the lowest abundance and diversity.
The magnitude of faunal differences was much smaller between old and young forests. When considered at
this local scale, anthropogenic modification of habitats did not result in a monotonous decline of diversity
because many herbivore pests and their associated predators and parasitoids were abundant and diverse in
gardens, where plant productivity was kept artificially high year-round through watering and crop rotation.
We used a variety of response variables to measure the strength of correlations across survey locations among
focal taxa. These could be ranked as follows in terms of decreasing number of significant correlations: species
turnover > abundance > observed species richness > estimated species richness > percentage of site-specific
species. The number of significant correlations was generally low and apparently unrelated to taxonomy
or guild structure. Our results emphasize the value of reporting species turnover in conservation studies, as
opposed to simply measuring species richness, and that the search for indicator taxa is elusive in the tropics.
One promising alternative might be to consider predictor sets of a small number of taxa representative of
different functional groups, as identified in our study.","Figure 1 - site map

We found significant differences in mosquito diversity among land use categories. Our results provide baseline data linking mosquito distribution to land use in the Peruvian Amazon and present an easily replicable method of comparison for future research.

SH1 27/11/2013 Added species status 'Not reported'.  Added linear extent (350m which is length of transect).  Changed use intensity 'cannot decide' for cattle pastures to 'light'.  The paper reports that the natural vegetation in the cattle pastures had been replaced therefore, was able to judge that should be at least light, but does not report whether pesticides and herbicides are used, therefore could not judge if intense use.  As the primary forests sites are on protected land I added minimal use intensity for these sites. The use intensity of other habitats is not posssible to ascertain from the paper.  Added patch size for primary forest sites (-1) as large reserve but this info is not given for the other sites.","We studied the diversity of dung beetles in three different habitats in the
Lacandona Forest, Chiapas, Mexico. We found a total of 49 species. Of these, 44 were in
well-preserved forests (SC) within the limits of the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve, 42
in fragmented forests (SF), and 13 in cattle pastures (PZ). These two latter habitats were
part of a fragmented landscape. Even though the species richness between the two forest
habitats is similar, there is a change in guild composition and structure. About 12% of the
species were exclusively found in SC, while 4.1% and 2% were exclusive of SF and PZ
respectively. b diversity was the most important element for overall diversity (c), above
that of the local richness (a). Within well-preserved forests, species composition changes
substantially, even among neighboring sites. Species diversity within the landscape seems
to depend on canopy coverage, soil temperature and geographic distance between sites.
Functional groups vary with the habitat. Large-bodied, nocturnal species with specific
requirements of soil temperature and compaction are more sensitive to anthropogenic
changes. In cattle pastures there is a larger number of heliophilic species, with a higher
percentage of small-bodied and roller beetles.","Figure 1 Map of sampling locationsAppendix A species abundance dataTable 2 functional trait data","","Alex Robinson","alexandra.robinson08@imperial.ac.uk","Sam Hill",1,38,1900,50

through converting forests into diverse land use systems. Land use management has an important impact
on soil and its functional role in maintaining ecosystem processes; it generally results in dramatic and rapid
changes in vegetation that are likely to affect soil invertebrate communities significantly. In the context of
the sustainable use of natural resources in tropical countries an investigation was conducted in Cote
dIvoire to study the impacts of land use type on biodiversity.
Methodology and results: Data were collected on ant diversity and relative abundance in five land use
types: (i) forest in Lamto reserve, (ii) rural forest, (iii) food crop plantations, (iv) cocoa and (v) pineapple
plantations, with the aim of characterizing ant assemblage in response to land use change. Standard
sampling methods (Winkler leaf litter extraction, pitfall trapping and soil monolith extraction) were used to
collect ants along three transects of 200 m length per land use type. A total of one hundred and eighteen
ant species were found in all habitats combined. The rural forest was the most species rich habitat (75
species), followed in decreasing order by the Lamto forest (73 species), food crop plantations (61 species),
cocoa plantations (45 species) and pineapple plantations (19 species).
Conclusions and application of findings: Three main conclusions were drawn from this study: (i) a decrease
in terrestrial ant diversity occurred with increasing land use intensification; (ii) food crop lands had levels of
ant diversity comparable to those of the forests; however, there were dramatic changes in the community
structure; (iii) the rural forests are near natural and may serve as refuges for ant diversity. These findings
encourage sustainable types of land use, involving agro-forestry practices to allow natural recovery
processes after agricultural disturbance. This approach will help in the conservation of biodiversity.

function worldwide. Here we investigate the effects of habitat fragmentation and drastic changes in
tree communities on dung beetle richness and community structure. This study was carried out in a
severely fragmented 670-km2 forest landscape of the Atlantic Forest of north-eastern Brazil. Sampling
was carried out in 19 forest fragments between September 2007 and March 2008 with the use of pitfall
traps and flight interception traps. A total of 5893 individuals and 30 species of dung beetle were collected.
Fragment area and isolation were the most significant explanatory variables for predictable and
conspicuous changes in dung beetle species richness. Smaller and isolated fragments presented lower
number of species, but fragments with lower tree species richness and lower proportion of shade-tolerant
species were also considerably impoverished in terms of dung beetle species richness. The body mass of
dung beetles were explained by fragment area and the percentage of emergent trees with smaller and
less stratified fragments being dominated by small-bodied dung beetles. An ordination analysis segregated
dung beetle communities between small fragments (<100 ha) and the control area. Seventy-seven
percent of the species were recorded in the control area and 22% of all species were unique to this habitat.
Our findings indicate that large fragments in the Atlantic Forest appear to consist in a sort of irreplaceable
habitats for particular groups of dung beetle species, as well as for the integrity of their communities.

biodiversity and associated ecosystem functions. Dung beetles (Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) provide an
ideal focal guild for such studies. We compared dung beetle assemblages and experimentally assessed
rates of dung removal and seed burial in undisturbed forest, low-intensity selectively logged forest under
sustainable forest management, and high-intensity logged forest, not under sustainable management in
Malaysian Borneo. In total, 7923 individuals from 39 species of dung beetle were collected. There were no
significant differences in abundance, biomass or diversity across sites. Species richness was significantly
lower in the high-intensity logged sites. Beta diversity was low: of 35 species recorded in undisturbed
forest sites, 32 were also captured in low-intensity sites and 29 in high-intensity sites. The environmental
and vegetation variables measured had little influence on species composition. An average of 6399% of
dung was removed over 24 h. Mean dung and seed removal were significantly lower in the high-intensity
logged sites. Dung removal rates were significantly and positively correlated with dung beetle species
richness, but not with dung beetle biomass or abundance. However, the biomass of large-bodied, nocturnal
dung beetles was positively correlated with dung removal. In contrast to previous studies, dung beetle
biomass and abundance were not correlated with species richness, indicative of density
compensation. Overall, dung beetle communities and associated ecosystem functions were robust to
low-intensity but not high-intensity selective logging. These differences may be related to changes in
the abundance and biomass of particular dung beetle species or guilds rather than community-wide measures
of abundance and biomass, highlighting the need to move beyond simplistic biodiversity-ecosystem
functioning correlations to understand the functional consequences of habitat modification in
high-diversity ecosystems.","Table 1: sampling site coordinates

richness and abundance are correlated with increasing prevalence of these two species. Therefore, our
objectives were to determine whether there are patterns in examined vegetation; how dominant species
contribute to these patterns; and how patterns differ between grazed and ungrazed vegetation. We
determined that protection from grazing increased species richness. Grazing significantly changed
composition through decreasing total plant, forb, grass and F. valesiaca covers, while substantially
increasing T. sipyleus cover. Topography, soil and grazing appear to impact the dominance of plant
communities where F. valesiaca and T. sipyleus prevail. These two dominant species had a significant
effect in shaping vegetation patterns. Based on regression analysis, alterations in species richness with
changes in cover of forbs and shrubs were evident, and spatial heterogeneity of F. valesiaca and T. sipyleus
indicated unstable vegetative patterns in heavily grazed pastures and successional changes in protected
pastures. Our study results identify F. valesiaca and T. sipyleus as indicator species of vegetation

life forms within tropical forest plant communities is
poorly understood. We studied the effect of degree of
fragmentation and surrounding matrix on trees,
lianas, shrubs and epiphytes in tropical forest fragments
of Kodagu, Western Ghats, India. These
fragments exist as sacred groves amidst a highly
modified agricultural landscape, and have been
preserved by the religious sentiments of local communities.
Plants were sampled at two sites in
continuous forests and 11 forest fragments. A total
of 122 species of trees, 29 species of lianas, 60
species of shrubs and 66 species of epiphytes were
recorded. Trees exhibited a significant speciesarea
relationship (R2 = 0.74). Richness estimates after
controlling for stem density (rarefaction) revealed
that observed speciesarea relationship was not an
artefact of passive sampling. Variation in species
richness of the other three groups was explained by
stem density and structural diversity. Linear distance
from the reserve forest did not explain any variation
in species richness. All life forms exhibited significant
nested pattern. Trees were nested along the area
gradient while nestedness in the other three groups
showed evidence in support of habitat nestedness.
The four life forms thus responded variably to degree
of fragmentation. Our study revealed that 74% of the
regional diversity for trees was contributed by
diversity among plots, highlighting the importance
of inter-patch habitat diversity in maintaining the
total regional species pool. We conclude that trees
alone cannot serve as good indicator for taking
appropriate conservation measures to mitigate species
loss resulting from habitat fragmentation.","Table 1 - Site locations

management tool in restoring degraded and burnt areas, as well as for economic purposes.
However, the quality of the biodiversity of these habitats has undergone little assessment.
Terrestrial gastropods are suitable indicators of forest quality and long-term stability
because of their strict dependence on microhabitat conditions and their slow dispersal rate.
We sampled the gastropod population in a protected Mediterranean area in order to
compare the species richness in seven main habitats. Holm oak wood and mixed-pine
forests were the habitats with the lowest species density, and areas with a high level of
heterogeneity exhibited the richest communities. In recent decades however, land abandonment
and pine reforestation are leading to landscape homogeneity, which is perhaps the
cause of the extinction of six open-habitat gastropod species in the Park. These results
provide park authorities with insights into how to adapt management plans to enhance
habitat quality for land snail and slug assemblages. More specifically, our results stress the need to create habitat heterogeneity to increase land mollusc diversity in large and continuous

inputs. Diversity was significantly higher in the block with the highest management inputs. The native tussock
Poa colensoi had significantly greater cover abundance while Festuca novae-zelandiae tussocks were significantly
taller in this block. Our results suggest that high management inputs reduce the abundance of H. pilosella and
diversity of native species, but increase the abundance of other adventive species and the cover and vigour
of native tussocks. Our results highlight an interesting management conundrum for short tussock grasslands.
No-input management is likely to result in a decline in native biodiversity, as well as production values, as H.
pilosella mats deplete soil nutrients and restrict regeneration of native species. However, input of fertiliser and
adventive seeds to enhance production values, although resulting in an increase in the vigour and abundance of
some native species (mainly tussocks) and a reduction in H.pilosella abundance, will also result in a decline in oerall native species richness.","","","Charlotte Chng","wen.chng11@imperial.ac.uk","Charlotte Chng",1,32,2720,85

Using a new approach to partition variance following an ordination analysis, we found that a synergistic interaction between habitat area and distance to edge was a more important determinant of patterns in beetle community composition than direct edge or area effects alone. The strength of edge effects in beetle-species composition increased nonlinearly with increasing fragment area. One important consequence of the synergy is that the slopes of speciesarea (SA) curves constructed from habitat islands depend sensitively on the distance from edge at which sampling is conducted. Surprisingly, we found negative SA curves for communities sampled at intermediate distances from habitat edges, caused by differential edge responses of matrix- vs. forest-specialist species in fragments of
increasing area. Our data indicate that distance to habitat edge has a consistently greater impact on beetle community composition than habitat area and that variation in the strength of edge effects may underlie many patterns that are superficially related to habitat area.","Information on study sites given on Page 98 - Table 1","","Charlotte Chng","wen.chng11@imperial.ac.uk","Charlotte Chng",1,233,208069,893

as they were stimulated by increased root growth (abundances up to 1.2×106 indm2).

may or may not overshadow the direct effect of rising temperatures on insects. Finally, recent
evidence for the importance of interaction effects between global change drivers suggests that
phenological responses of communities to climate may be altered by other drivers. We used a
natural temperature gradient (generated by elevation and topology), combined with
experimental nitrogen fertilization, to investigate the effects of elevated temperature and
globally increasing anthropogenic nitrogen deposition on the structure and phenology of a
seminatural grassland herbivore assemblage (lepidopteran insects).
We found that both drivers, alone and in combination, severely altered how the relative
abundance and composition of species changed through time. Importantly, warmer
temperatures were associated with biotic homogenization, such that herbivore assemblages
in the warmest plots had more similar species composition than those in intermediate or cool
plots. Changes in herbivore composition and abundance were largely mediated by changes in
the plant community, with increased nonnative grass cover under high treatment levels being
the strongest determinant of herbivore abundance. In addition to compositional changes, total
herbivore biomass more than doubled under elevated nitrogen and increased more than
fourfold with temperature, bearing important functional implications for herbivores as
consumers and as a prey resource. The crucial role of nonnative plant dominance in mediating
responses of herbivores to change, combined with the frequent nonadditive (positive and
negative) effects of the two drivers, and the differential responses of species, highlight that

The way in which species interactions are altered at habitat edges is an emerging concern in conservation biology, with some theories predicting edge-affected habitats to be less stable and exhibit intensified species interactions relative to interior habitats. One little-studied interaction is phoresy, where an individual of one species attaches itself to an individual of another species for the purpose of dispersal. Bumble bees (Bombus spp.) are important crop pollinators around the world and at least 10 species of phoretic mites have been associated with various bumble bee species.
2. Here, we investigated changes in the abundance of the introduced European B. terrestris across forest-grassland edges in the Southern Alps of New Zealand, and concomitant changes in the phoretic mite loads on these mobile pollinators.
3. Bumble bees penetrated up to 250 m inside forest fragments, with abundance declining with distance from the anthropogenic matrix habitat. By contrast, phoretic mite loads increased towards the forest interior. Overall, phoretic mite loads on B. terrestris were greatest in the forest canopy, suggesting that this species interaction is intensified in natural habitat compared to that in the anthropogenic land use surrounding forest fragments.

Dramatic declines in honeybee populations around the globe, however, questioned the sustainability of this reliance on a single pollinator species. In this study, I investigated the response of wild pollinator communities to declining honeybee density and changing land use intensity to determine the potential of wild pollinators to compensate for honeybee loss in increasingly human-modified environment. I generated a gradient of declining honeybee density using increasing distances from commercial bee hives, and conducted flower observations on experimentally-grown plants across this gradient. I investigate how declining honeybee densities and intensifying land use combine to influence the composition of the pollinator community as a whole, then go on to explore individual trends in the most common pollinator species. I then analyze how this impacts the transport of viable pollen by the pollinator community and determine how these changes alter seed set in several common plant species. I then change my focus away from the composition of the pollinator community, and instead investigate how declining honeybee densities and land-use intensification influence the structuring of interactions between plants and pollinators within the community. I identify the pollen species carried by pollinators, and use this to construct a network of pollination interactions. I then use this network to analyze how changes in the way species interact influences the pollination services delivered by the pollinator community to different plant groups (weeds, native plants, and crop species).

My findings show that honeybee declines may have a large impact on community structure and interactions within pollination systems. I observed a significant shift in the wild pollinator community composition as honeybee densities declined, from a generally bee/hoverfly dominated community to one more dominated by large flies. This was associated with a significant decline in the total pollen load transported by the community, indicating that pollination services may suffer in the absence of honeybees. As honeybee densities declined, however, I also observed a shift toward greater specialisation of pollinators on abundant resources, increased pollinator constancy, and a higher viability rate of the pollen transported. These findings show that although the total amount of pollen transported by the community declined as honeybee densities decreased, the probability of this pollen transport resulting in effective pollination likely increased. Thus, I observed no decrease in seed set with honeybee declines in any of the three plant species tested, and one of these even showed a significant increase. Finally, I also demonstrated that this change differentially affected different plant types, and that the extent of changes to each plant species differed between land-use types. This reflected changes in the relative abundance of pollen types in different land uses, with greater specialisation in the absence of honeybees disproportionately benefiting common species. These findings have strong implications for several contemporary issues in pollination biology, both locally within New Zealand and on a global scale. These are discussed in the following sections.

Finally, I conclude by discussing the implications of this research on several contemporary issues in pollination biology, namely the ability for wild pollinators to compensate for honeybee declines, the impact of honeybees on natural new Zealand ecosystems, the contribution of honeybees to invasive weed pollination and finally the management of surrounding land use types to maximize the effectiveness of wild pollinators.","Study site descriptions are given in Page 19, 20 and 22 of the thesis","","Charlotte Chng","wen.chng11@imperial.ac.uk","Charlotte Chng",1,18,1386,77

Aim Pollination services are at risk from land use change and intensification, but responses of individual pollinator species are often variable, making it difficult to detect and understand community-level impacts on pollination. We investigated changes in community composition and functional diversity of insect pollinator communities under land use change in a highly modified
landscape.

Location Canterbury region, South Island, New Zealand.

Methods We trapped insect pollinators every month for 1 year at 24 sites across four land use types of increasing intensity in New Zealand: gardens with native vegetation, blackcurrant orchards, dairy farms, and rotational cropping farms. We investigated changes in pollinator species and functional richness and differences in species and functional composition.
Results Under increasing land use intensity, both species and functional richness declined markedly. Changes in functional richness, however, were overall not significantly different than expected based on the observed declines in species
richness. Nevertheless, there was a significant trend towards greater than expected functional richness within less-intensive land use types and lower than expected functional richness within intensive land use types. The order of species loss under increasing land use intensity was non-random, as pollinators with a narrow diet breadth, large body size, solitary behaviour and a preference for non-floral larval food resources were lost first. 

Main conclusions Our study shows that pollinator species bearing particular trait attributes are susceptible to differences in land use. Our study suggests that pollination services may be more vulnerable to environmental changes and disturbances in more intensive land use types as a result of lower pollinator functional richness.","Within the publication - map of study site available in Suppinfo_AppendixS1.doc","","Charlotte Chng","wen.chng11@imperial.ac.uk","Charlotte Chng",1,24,599,25

A total of 70 species was found. The moderate decline of oribatid species richness at the 5-years-old stand together with a strong deviation from the log-series model indicate that the community had not recovered from initial disturbance after 5 years. Close community similarity between the 5 and the 95-years-old stands nevertheless suggests a delayed response of the oribatid fauna to strong changes in environmental conditions. Species richness significantly increased from 5 to 25-years-old stand. This was accompanied by a strong increase of oribatid abundance that was largely due to the increase of only two species: Oppiella nova and Tectocepheus velatus. Particularly strong deviation from the log-series model at this site suggests that community disturbance becomes most intense at intermediate stages of forest development. Further analyses revealed an alteration of the feeding structure as well as a stimulation of species that either prefer or are at least able to colonize deeper layers of the soil profile in the 25-years-old stand. This indicates marked changes in both nutritional conditions and microclimate in the uppermost horizons 25 years after clear-cutting.

A very high C mineralization rate measured in the 5-years-old stand confirms the important contribution of decomposition processes to net ecosystem production in young stands. However, no strong correlation between oribatid mite community variance and environmental conditions could be established by means of a canonical correspondence analysis. It is concluded that oribatid mite communities are a fairly conservative element of the decomposer fauna in temperate spruce forests and might thus be an important component in the decomposer systems buffering mechanisms against strong environmental change. Our data indicate a multifaceted reaction of the oribatid community to long lasting changes in site conditions rather than a straightforward response to certain environmental factors.","Table A1 (page 1925)","","Callum Martin","callum.martin12@imperial.ac.uk","Callum Martin",1,4,288,72

Economic drivers are now leading to the abandonment of agricultural lands, and the area in secondary forests is increasing. We know little about how long it takes for these ecosystems to achieve the structural and compositional characteristics of primary forests. In this study, we examine changes in plant species composition and aboveground biomass during eight decades of tropical secondary succession in Puerto Rico, and compare these patterns with primary forests. Using a well-replicated chronosequence approach, we sampled primary forests and secondary forests established 10, 20, 30, 60, and 80 years ago on abandoned pastures. Tree species composition in all secondary forests was different from that of primary forests and could be divided into early (10-, 20-, and 30-year) vs. late (60- and 80-year) successional phases. The highest rates of aboveground biomass accumulation occurred in the first 20 years, with rates of C sequestration peaking at 6.7 ± 0.5 Mg C·ha1·yr1. Reforestation of pastures resulted in an accumulation of 125 Mg C/ha in aboveground standing live biomass over 80 years. The 80 year-old secondary forests had greater biomass than the primary forests, due to the replacement of woody species by palms in the primary forests. Our results show that these new ecosystems have different species composition, but similar species richness, and significant potential for carbon sequestration, compared to remnant primary forests.","Table 2 (p. 832)","","Callum Martin","callum.martin12@imperial.ac.uk","Callum Martin",1,18,918,51

We sampled two forest sites representing each of the three former land-use types (i.e., a total of six sites) and measured the diameter at breast height (dbh) of all stems with dbh ≥1 cm and at least 2 m in height. All individuals were identified to species and classified into each of four dbh sizes-classes: 1–3, 3–5, 5–10, and >10 cm. No major differences in structure or diversity were evident among land-use types. Total tree densities varied from 2575 ± 55 to 4745 ± 985 individuals/ha and total basal areas ranged from 12.5 ± 2.6 to 14.6 ± 0.3 m2/ha (mean and S.E.). Neither one differed significantly (p < 0.05) among land-use types. Overall, the most abundant tree size-class was the 1–3 cm dbh (47% of the total number of trees), whereas trees greater than 10 cm dbh were the least abundant (4%). We found significantly higher density and basal area (p = 0.01) in NU than in HD and P only in the smallest trees (1–3 cm dbh). We identified a total of 87 species in 28 families. The Leguminosae plant family had the greatest species richness and number of individuals in all land-use types. The HD land-use type showed lower total species richness than P and NU only with two of the four nonparametric estimators. Observed species richness decreased as dbh increased in all land-use types. At least 5 legumes were among the 10 most dominant species in all land-use types, of which the non-native Mimosa arenosa was the most dominant one. It represented between 42% and 52% of the total basal area in each land-use type. The secondary forests have reached, on average, 74% and 22% of the total density and basal area, respectively, of an average primary tropical dry forest of Mexico. The high number of individuals 1–3 cm dbh (48% of the total and 83% of the species) suggest that regeneration is occurring in all land-use types, although to different degrees. The absence of small individuals of M. arenosa and a high abundance of primary forest species at NU, suggest that M. arenosa is being replaced at these sites.","Appendix A (p. 44-45)","","Callum Martin","callum.martin12@imperial.ac.uk","Callum Martin",1,6,582,97

we have an insufficient understanding of the value of these habitats for biodiversity conservation, and almost none for most
arthropods in species-rich tropical forests. We sampled epigeic arachnids (Amblypygi, Araneae, Opiliones, Scorpiones, and
Uropygi) in primary, secondary (1419 years), and Eucalyptus plantation (45 years) forests in the Jari region of
northeastern Brazilian Amazonia. We sampled five independent sites in each forest type between January and June 2005,
collecting a total of 4824 individuals (3177 adults, 112 species), including 1864 adults (75 species) in Eucalyptus, 776 (60) in
secondary forest, and 536 (72) in primary forest. We compared species richness, species-abundance distributions, and
community structure, between the three forest types and identified the species that were characteristic of each forest type.
Rarefaction analyses showed that undisturbed primary forest harbored significantly more species and a similar overall
abundance as second-growth forest; while levels of species richness were similar between secondary forest and Eucalyptus.
The species composition and abundance structure of arachnid assemblages was distinct in all three forest types.
Considering all species sampled, 19% were only sampled in primary forest, 4% in secondary forest, and 19% in Eucalyptus.
Most species sampled in plantation forests are known to be wide-ranging habitat generalists. Our data indicate that
regenerating forests are not biological deserts (57% and 56% of species sampled in primary forest were also captured in
secondary and plantation forests respectively) and can, therefore, help mitigate some of the negative effects of deforestation
for epigeic arachnids. However, these replacement habitats do not provide a substitute for primary forest and may fail to
conserve many of those species most at risk from extinction.","Table 1 (p. 396)

Here, we present the largest chronosequence data set on forest succession in the wet tropics that includes both secondary and old-growth sites. We performed 0.1 ha vegetation inventories in 30 sites in northeastern Costa Rica, including seven old-growth forests and 23 secondary forests on former pastures, ranging from 10 to 42 yr. The secondary forest sites were formerly pasture for intervals of <125 yr. Aboveground biomass in secondary forests recovered rapidly, with sites already exhibiting values comparable to old growth after 2130 yr, and biomass accumulation was not impacted by the length of time that a site was in pasture. Species richness reached old-growth levels in as little as 30 yr, although sites that were in pasture for > 10 yr had significantly lower species richness. Forest cover near the sites at the time of forest establishment did not significantly impact biomass or species richness, and the species composition of older secondary forest sites (>30 yr) converged with that of old growth. These results emphasize the resilience of tropical ecosystems in this region and the high conservation value of secondary forests.","Table S1 and S2 (supporting information)","","Callum Martin","callum.martin12@imperial.ac.uk","Callum Martin",1,30,14310,477

Each site was sampled once. Species richness of the earthworms was generally low and varied little between sites. At all sites except for one, the peregrine species Pontoscolex corethrurus (Glossoscolecidae) strongly dominated. Three other peregrine species, Amynthas corticis, Amynthas gracilis (Megascolecidae) and Ocnerodrilus occidentalis (Ocnerodrilidae), were frequent in moist sites. No autochthonous species were found. Abundance and biomass of earthworms varied strongly within and between sites (0-338 individuals m-2, 0-96 g m-2 fresh weight). Pastures had significantly lower abundance than all other sites. The forest sites had similar earthworm abundance and biomass, with a tendency to be higher in younger succession stages. The coastal plain region has been strongly altered by human activities. Reasons for the lack of any autochthonous species and the dominance of one peregrine species require further investigation.","Table 1 (p. 1042)","","Callum Martin","callum.martin12@imperial.ac.uk","Callum Martin",1,51,306,6

In 1998, Hurricane Georges struck Puerto Rico, affecting both chronosequences.

Stem densities decreased in all sites with a significant effect of age-class. Intermediate-aged sites had the greatest decrease in density and the largest change in the distribution of size classes. Although there was a significant decrease in the small size classes (<10 cm dbh), due to physical damage from falling debris, there was a large increase in the 1020 cm dbh classes, due to growth of surviving stems. Basal area decreased in 11 of the 15 sites and showed only a slight gain in the other sites. Species richness decreased in all but one site and there was a greater proportional loss of shrub species than tree species. Multivariate ordination successfully placed the resampled sites within their original ordinations with acceptable stress, indicating there was no significant change in species composition or deviation from successional pathways during the period. Compared with effects of land-use, hurricanes create minor variation from expected successional pathways. However, hurricanes contribute to regional- and landscape-scale variation in both stand structure and species composition.","","","Callum Martin","callum.martin12@imperial.ac.uk","Callum Martin",1,71,6532,92

Here we analyse >100,000 observations of individuals from 11 taxonomic groups and >2,500 species, covering up to 19 years of post-logging regeneration, and quantify the impacts of logging on carbon storage and biodiversity within lowland dipterocarp forests of Sabah, Borneo. We estimate that forests lost ca. 53% of above-ground biomass as a result of logging but despite this high level of degradation, logged forest retained considerable conservation value: floral species richness was higher in logged forest than in primary forest and whilst faunal species richness was typically lower in logged forest, in most cases the difference between habitats was no greater than ca. 10%. Moreover, in most studies >90% of species recorded in primary forest were also present in logged forest, including species of conservation concern. During recovery, logged forest accumulated carbon at five times the rate of natural forest (1.4 and 0.28 Mg C ha1 year1, respectively). We conclude that allowing the continued regeneration of extensive areas of Borneos forest that have already been logged, and are at risk of conversion to other land uses, would provide a significant carbon store that is likely to increase over time. Protecting intact forest is critical for biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation, but the contribution of logged forest to these twin goals should not be overlooked.","Table 1 (p. 990)

Fruit-feeding butterflies were trapped to measure differences between butterfly communities in primary rainforest and disturbed forest habitats of different stage of regeneration including clear-cut, abandoned farmland, newly planted forest and middle-aged secondary growth. 3465 specimens representing 114 species were identified from 56 traps operated for 36 days. Extremely high values of rarefied species richness were estimated in the clear-cut habitat, due to the high number of singletons and doubletons. This was caused by a gap-effect that allowed penetration of canopy and open area species after disturbance. The differences between butterfly communities were best demonstrated through ecological composition, richness and abundance of indicator groups and habitat similarity based on Jaccard's similarity index. The results show a clear ability of butterfly communities in degraded forest habitats to regenerate in 50-60 years after clearance.","Table 3 (p. 357-358)","","Callum Martin","callum.martin12@imperial.ac.uk","Callum Martin",1,7,798,114

Secondary forests can benefit fauna by providing suitable habitats, connecting forests fragments, and increasing gene flow. Previous studies of forest regeneration have showed different levels of amphibian recovery. In Puerto Rico, 15 years old secondary forests achieved similar amphibian species richness and composition in comparison with old-growth forests, while in Brazil secondary forests from 14 to 19 years of recovery only recovered 60% of the species of old-growth forests. We evaluated amphibian recovery in secondary forests in northeastern Costa Rica, by assessing amphibian recovery in 12 secondary forests that vary in age of recovery and in three old-growth forests using visual and acoustic surveys. Our sites varied in terms of their landscape (e.g. amount of surrounding forest) and forest characteristics (e.g. forest age, aboveground biomass, basal area, number of tree species, number of stems, leaf-litter depth), but there was no relationship between these characteristics and amphibian species richness or species composition. We found that amphibians are recovering rapidly in secondary forests in Costa Rica, and even young forests (1016 years) had similar species richness and composition in comparison with old-growth forests. These forests are providing suitable microhabitats conditions for amphibians. In addition, this study highlights the importance of landscape characteristics. The abundance of amphibian species sources (e.g. forest patches) and connections between forests appear to be helping the species colonize these sites. Worldwide, the area of secondary forests is increasing, and our results show that these habitats are suitable for a diversity of amphibian species, suggesting that these forests can help reduce amphibian population and species decline.","Table 1 (p. 174)

plant species and functional diversity (excluding adult canopy trees) of 48 sites from four forest land
use types (two types of primary forest, secondary forest and abandoned tree plantations) and two common
human-maintained land use types (coconut plantations and grazed pastures) across three elevation

have had divergent responses to land use change in forest land uses indicative of a loss of functional
redundancy. Despite structural and compositional similarities among primary forests and degraded forest
land uses, full recovery of secondary and commercial plantations has not been achieved. We suggest

Because of this many are now being cleared for alternative land uses. But there are a variety of types of secondary forest differing in the extent to which they have been disturbed, the frequency at which this has taken place and, because of their position in the landscape, in their capacity to be recolonized from species from intact primary forests. This
means that some secondary forests may not be as degraded as is supposed and many may have the capacity to recover if protected from further disturbances. This study reports on a comparison between remnant forest, and frequently and infrequently disturbed secondary forests in Lao PDR. The frequently disturbed forest had been cleared for shifting cultivation 35 times in the past 30 years while the infrequently disturbed sites had been cleared only once. The study found comparatively small differences in the occurrence of primary forest species in these two types of secondary forest and that they still contained
a large proportion of primary forest tree species despite the disturbance history. This apparent resilience may be due to the capacity of many species to resprout after disturbances and their ability to recolonize across the present agricultural matrix.","","","Callum Martin","callum.martin12@imperial.ac.uk","Callum Martin",1,18,882,49

In agreement with expectation, carabid abundance and species richness decreased significantly from rural to urban sites. Furthermore, no large, and only few individuals of medium-sized specialist species were collected from the urban environment, while many specimens of medium-sized and some large-sized specialist species were collected from the suburban and rural sites. Hiroshima city was characterised by medium-sized generalist carabids, while the suburbs and the rural environments were characterised by small-sized generalist beetles. These results did not apply at the species level. To summarise, we found a significant effect of urbanisation on the composition of carabid beetle assemblages in Hiroshima City. These changes were similar to those found in previous studies performed in Sofia (Bulgaria), Edmonton (Canada) and Helsinki (Finland).

Twenty sites with Quercus ilex trees were chosen in a Mediterranean area both in urban and natural locations, with an altitude ranging from 0 to about 500 m a.s.l., in coastal and inland areas (Campania, Italy). Data on the presence of species, cover values and phenology were recorded for each site and the Index of Atmospheric Purity (IAP) was calculated. The data matrix of frequency/cover x species was analysed by multivariate methods. Data obtained clearly show that in urban sites the number of species and IAP values are lower, and that acrocarpous mosses and vegetative reproduction occur more frequently. Contents of trace elements (Al, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Ti, V, Zn) were measured in four species and concentrations were normalised to the soil pattern by calculating the Enrichment Factor (EF). The results show the large contribution of resuspended soil particles to the chemical composition of the analysed bryophytes. All the examined species were enriched in Cd, Cu and Zn, and in some cases showed high EF for Pb.

Given the large and ever increasing extent of urban areas, and that the insect species richness there can be high, it is important to know the factors determining that aspect of biodiversity. In this study two of these factors, namely habitat management and area, were considered. Arboreal and grassland Hemiptera, and grassland plants, were sampled on 18 roundabouts and other road enclosed sites in the town of Bracknell. Hemiptera were sampled using suction sampling and tree beating. A significant species-area relationship was found for arboreal Hemiptera, which was strongly related to habitat diversity. For both grassland plants and Hemiptera, grassland management, by mowing, had a significant effect on species richness. Despite the management grassland plants showed a significant species-area relationship. However the effect of management on Hemiptera was great enough to outweigh any area effect. As the size of open spaces is often constrained in urban areas, altering habitat management has a greater potential. for enhancing biodiversity. For arboreal Hemiptera choice of trees for planting is of particular importance, white for grassland Hemiptera diversity would be increased with a reduction in the intensity of management, such a reduction in the frequency of mowing.","","","Dominic Bennett","dominic.bennett08@imperial.ac.uk","Dominic Bennett",3,54,4140,230

Between May and July 2000 nine woodlots were sampled along three axes representing urban - rural gradients from the centre of the city of Hamburg to its rural borders. Species richness decreased towards the city centre and with increasing isolation of the sites but was uncorrelated with the size of the site. Species assemblages were highly nested making successive loss of species predictable. Responsivness towards urbanization could not be linked to specific life history traits. Body length of one species (Carabus nemoralis) declined towards the city centre. Four species were found at all sites. These four species showed differences in fluctuating asymmetry (FA) at the different sites that could not be interpreted as an indication of responses to habitat suitability. FA of the remaining species (species negatively affected by urbanization) increased towards the city centre and with increasing isolation of a site. This matched the prediction that FA indicates habitat quality. Thus, urban effects lead to changes of communities through a predictable loss of species, to a reduction in body size in one species, and to increased FA in species which are susceptible to urbanization. The results indicate that the different sites were islands in an urban matrix rather than parts of a green network which would allow free exchange of plants and animals within the city of Hamburg.","","Life history traits, in table 1, pag 196.

The average number of species per trap did not differ significantly among the three urbanisation stages. The average number of forest species was significantly higher in the forest area (6.2 species/trap) than in either the suburban (4.12 spp/trap) or the urban (3.7 spp/trap) areas. Both the number of open-habitat species (1.8 spp/trap), and the generalist species (2.3 spp/trap) were highest in the urban area. The number of predaceous species was highest in the forest area (8.1 spp/trap), while the number of omnivorous species was highest in the urban area (0.9 spp/trap). Multivariate statistical procedures (NMDS, Sorensen similarity index) also confirmed that species composition changed remarkably along the forest-suburban-urban gradient. The highest number of species (S = 37) was found at the urban area, deviating from trends at other northern hemisphere sites (Canada, Finland) where the overall species richness was highest at the forest habitats. Urban green areas, including forest patches contribute to the quality of urban life and thus should be conserved. Apart from their recreational value, which is widely appreciated and enjoyed by human inhabitants, such green urban spaces provide seemingly adequate habitat for numerous species of ground beetles found in less developed forest areas some distance from the city core.","","functional_data.csv","Dominic Bennett","dominic.bennett08@imperial.ac.uk","Dominic Bennett",1,3,129,43

Native species are replaced with widespread non-native species and ants are among the worlds most notorious invaders. To date, all documented cases of ant invasions involve exotic introduced species that are spread around the world by human-mediated dispersal. I investigated the effect of urbanization on the evolution of invasive characteristics in a native ant species, the odorous house ant, Tapinoma sessile (Say). Colony social structure, life history traits, and the spatial pattern of nest distribution were compared by sampling T. sessile across a gradient of three distinct habitats: natural, semi-natural, and urban. Results demonstrate a remarkable transition in colony social and spatial structure and life history traits between natural and urban environments. In natural habitats, T. sessile colonies are comprised of small, monogyne (single queen), and monodomous (single nest) colonies. In urban areas, T. sessile often exhibit extreme polygyny and polydomy, form large supercolonies, and become a dominant pest. Results also suggest that urban T. sessile colonies may have a negative impact on native ant abundance and diversity. In the natural environment T. sessile coexisted with a wide array of other ant species, while very few ant species were present in the urban environment invaded by T. sessile. Habitat degradation and urbanization can lead to extreme changes in social and spatial colony structure and life history traits in a native ant species and can promote the evolution of invasive characteristics such as polygyny, polydomy, and supercolonial colony structure.","","ecological_data.xlsx","Dominic Bennett","dominic.bennett08@imperial.ac.uk","Dominic Bennett",1,45,1305,29

26/11/2013 SH1 As LH1 noticed inconsistencies between the data provided by the author and the spreadsheet, I have been back through the data provided by the author and have added data for 5 sites which were previously blank - sites 101,102,103,105 and 110.  Within the data for these sites were three species not recorded within any other sites, therefore I added three new species rows in the site by species matrix.  Note that neither the species nor the sites appear in the summarised data provided by the author in 'All_Data_Durescumming.xls' - the data is only contained in the tabs for each of the sites.  It appears that the summarised datafile was what was used for the paper as these species do not appear in the paper either.

SH1 26/11/2013 Changed fragmentation layout from 'cannot decide' to 'part of remnant patch' for all sites.  Looked at blocking structure and is correct - there are no blocks of sampling.  Added linear extent value and checked habitat patch size and is correctly entered.
SH1 28/05/14 Changed predominant habitat from Urban to Primary for all sites as samples were taken within remnant patches of primary.  Use intensity was assessed using Google Maps - areas with obvious footpaths, cleared patches etc were classified as Intense use, other areas were assessed as Light use.","There are many variables within an urban landscape that can be expected to influence faunal diversity. We used a mechanistic approach to observe the relative importance of each of these variables in describing the diversity of avian communities in urban and peri-urban areas of Cape Town, South Africa situated within Cape Floristic Region, a global plant biodiversity hotspot. We expected to find a strong influence of habitat amount and arrangement across a fragmented urban-rural gradient. Birds were sampled in patches of fragmented Cape Flats Sand Fynbos at 39 locations during the middle of summer (November-January 2008/2009). Environmental data included on-site observations, existing GIS layers, and remotely sensed data. Bird community composition was related to habitat amount, arrangement, and quality. Correlations, partial correlations and structural equation analysis showed that habitat amount and arrangement had insignificant effects on species richness across the urban gradient. Changes in urban density and the presence or absence of the invasive alien tree species Acacia saligna (blue wattle) appeared to be the main drivers of avian species richness. Increasing urban density, decreasing A. saligna density and decreasing canopy height correlated with higher avian species richness, with confounding variables corrected for. For the management of urban biodiversity, our results suggest that the most urgent focus should be on retaining the quality remaining areas of native vegetation (and particularly, containing the spread of A salgina) rather than extending current networks with poor quality habitat. More generally, habitat quality appears to be more important than habitat amount or arrangement in this system. We suggest that this observation be encorporated into further research to more effectively predict avian responses to landscape change and that more must be done to adequately capture the critical and complex role of the matrix in terrestrial systems.","","","Dominic Bennett","dominic.bennett08@imperial.ac.uk","Dominic Bennett",1,39,3237,83

Urbanisation destroys, degrades and fragments native ecosystems, replacing them with a heterogeneous matrix of urban development, parks, roads, and isolated remnant fragments of varying size and quality. This presents a major challenge for biodiversity conservation within urban areas. To make spatially explicit decisions about urban biodiversity conservation actions, urban planners and managers need to be able to separate the relative influence of landscape composition and configuration from patch and local (site)-scale variables for a range of fauna species. We address this problem using a hierarchical landscape approach for native, terrestrial reptiles and small mammals living in a fragmented semi-urban landscape of Brisbane, Australia. Generalised linear modelling and hierarchical partitioning analysis were applied to quantify the relative influence of landscape composition and configuration, patch size and shape, and local habitat composition and structure on the species' richness of mammal and reptile assemblages. Landscape structure (composition and configuration) and local-scale habitat structure variables were found to be most important for influencing reptile and mammal assemblages, although the relative importance of specific variables differed between reptile and mammal assemblages. These findings highlight the importance of considering landscape composition and configuration in addition to local habitat elements when planning and/or managing for the conservation of native, terrestrial fauna diversity in urban landscapes.","","","Dominic Bennett","dominic.bennett08@imperial.ac.uk","Dominic Bennett",1,60,2100,35

We found that overall spider species richness was significantly higher in the urban sites compared to the suburban and rural ones. The increased diversity was due to the significantly more open-habitat species in the assemblages at the urban sites. This suggests that species from the surrounding matrix (grasslands and arable lands) penetrated the disturbed urban sites. The ratio of forest species was significantly higher in the rural sites than in the suburban and urban ones, suggesting that forest species are indeed sensitive to the disturbance caused by urbanization. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed that the species composition changed remarkably along the urbanization gradient. Open-habitat spiders were associated with the urban sites of higher ground and air temperature. Forest spiders were characteristic of the rural sites with higher amount of decaying woods. Our findings suggest that the overall diversity was not the most appropriate indicator of disturbance; species with different habitat affinity should be analyzed separately to get an ecologically relevant picture of the effect of urbanization.","","","Dominic Bennett","dominic.bennett08@imperial.ac.uk","Dominic Bennett",1,12,300,25

The urbanized area consists of five concentric zones, which are based on the citys ring road system. Willow trees (Salix spp.) are commonly planted and abundant in the city. In this study, we determined the effects of urbanization on willow trunk-dwelling weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionoidea) in a 3-year survey. Our results indicated that species richness and abundance decreased from outskirts to the urban center. It was estimated that within a 30-km limit, species richness and abundance might be reduced by 0.9 species and 59.3% of individuals per 5 km toward urban center. Landscape variables (e.g., the proportion of impervious surface and distance to urban center) explained 59.4% of species richness and 43.9% of species abundance. Local variables (e.g., plant resources and site size) explained only 4.9% of species richness and 4.7% of species abundance. Our results show that there is a negative relationship between urban expansion and weevil diversity. There are several ways in which such detrimental effects on biodiversity could be mitigated: (1) Optimization of urban landscape structures, as well as vegetation planting; (2) increasing connectivity between urban remnants and natural landscapes in the outskirts of the city; and (3) limiting the proportion of impervious surface in inner urban zones.","","Su 2012 What's Under a Plastic Strip Hidden Urban Biodiversity in the Beijing Metropolitan Area.pdf","Dominic Bennett","dominic.bennett08@imperial.ac.uk","Dominic Bennett",1,25,475,19

the major cause of biodiversity loss. However, no study has identified an explicit connection between urbanization and
biodiversity loss as the impact of urbanization is typically inferred indirectly by comparing species diversity along urbanrural
gradients at a single time point. A different approach is to focus on the temporal rather than the spatial aspect and
perform before and after studies where species diversity is cataloged over time in the same sites. The current study
examined changes in ant abundance and diversity associated with the conversion of natural habitats into urban habitats.
Ant abundance and diversity were tracked in forested sites that became urbanized through construction and were
examined at 3 time points - before, during, and after construction. On average, 4.361.2 unique species were detected in
undisturbed plots prior to construction. Ant diversity decreased to 0.760.8 species in plots undergoing construction and
1.561.1 species in plots 1 year after construction was completed. With regard to species richness, urbanization resulted in
the permanent loss of 17 of the 20 species initially present in the study plots. Recovery was slow and only 3 species were
present right after construction was completed and 4 species were present 1 year after construction was completed. The
second objective examined ant fauna recovery in developed residential lots based on time since construction, neighboring
habitat quality, pesticide inputs, and the presence of invasive ants. Ant diversity was positively correlated with factors that
promoted ecological recovery and negatively correlated with factors that promoted ecological degradation. Taken together,
these results address a critical gap in our knowledge by characterizing the short- and long-term the effects of urbanization
on the loss of ant biodiversity.","","ecological_data.xlsx","Dominic Bennett","dominic.bennett08@imperial.ac.uk","Dominic Bennett",1,45,900,20

We investigated species diversity of terrestrial gastropods across an urban gradient in a metropolitan area. We considered 34 sites of different degrees of urbanization and of different thermal stress classes (TSC) that were derived from a classification of urban heat load based on the physiological equivalent temperature (PET). A total of 31 species were recorded with 021 species per site (mean: 4.4 ± 5.2 species per site). Alpha diversity was best explained by TSC, bush cover and perennial vegetation cover, and it decreased with
increasing thermal stress. Overall, thermal stress predicted snail and slug species richness better than urban cover (ANOVA(analysis of variance); TSC: F = 10.0, p < 0.001; urbanization: F = 3.9, p = 0.018), and the proportional loss in species richness was higher for native species than for introduced species.

Methods  We selected four sites with similar physical conditions but different development phases in Rangtang County.

ANOVA analysis was used to detect differences among bryophyte communities, and the relationship between vascular plant and bryophyte communities was examined by partial correlations.

Important findings   Bryophyte composition changed significantly during developmental processes of young forests. Photophilic or pleurocarpous mosses were dominant species, while some hygrophilous mosses expanded their populations and become dominant species locally and drought-tolerant species occurred because of disturbance. Richness index (2237) and diversity index (0.371.08) increased during the process of development, and the four young forestlands had differences in structural characteristics. There was a positive relationship between cover of tree and shrub layers and development of bryophytes. Shrub layer significantly promoted bryophyte richness, while pioneer grass with strong development and litter restrained bryophyte development. Characteristics of development in tree, shrub, litter layer and their interaction changed dynamically during the developmental process.Promoting development of tree and shrub layers has an important role on enhancing bryophytes.","page 820, Table 3","","Di Gao","di.gao13@imperial.ac.uk","Di Gao",1,4,200,50

heliophilous, and disturbance-resistant acrocarpous mosses with a high sporulation ability had expanded their
populations, while some hygrophilous pleurocarpous mosses sensitive to early successional conditions had
disappeared. Secondly, diversity indices, coverage, and biomass decreased during the natural recovery process,

species composition of shifting cultivation fallows was distinct from other forest types but logged forests
were similar to old growth forests, especially in lowland forests. Disturbance intensity was the most frequently

reforestation with coniferous trees are two widely practiced
forest regeneration strategies after timber harvesting. They
lead to different tree species composition and may cause
different understory biodiversity, but the effects on ground
bryophyte composition and diversity are not well-known.
& Aims We tested whether natural regeneration with broadleaved
species and reforestation with spruce induced different diversities
of the ground bryophyte populations 2040 years after oldgrowth
spruce forest clearcutting in the subalpine regions of
southwestern China.
& Methods Differences between natural stands and plantations
were compared through the analysis of 13 paired stands, with
78 plots, 390 shrub/herb quadrats, and a total of 1,560 bryophyte
quadrats.
& Results Naturally regenerated forests were characterized by
lower density and cover and lower tree height but higher
herbaceous plant height, shrub cover, and bryophyte diversity.
They also harbored many more ground bryophytes. The species
richness of pleurocarpousmosses and fans,mats, and turfs were
significantly higher in naturally regenerated forests. Frequency
difference analysis demonstrated that more bryophyte species
preferred ground habitats in naturally regenerated forests than
in plantations (116 vs. 48 species). The canonical correspondence
analysis indicated that stand structure attributes were
more important determinants of ground bryophyte diversity
and abundance.
& Conclusion Natural regeneration and reforestation resulted
in large differences in ground bryophyte populations. A larger
diversity was observed in the former case, and natural regeneration
practices can be an effective measure for the protection
of ground bryophyte diversity after clearcutting.","page 854-860, table 6 & 7","","Di Gao","di.gao13@imperial.ac.uk","Di Gao",1,26,6032,232

previously) with a diversity of indigenous species. Ants (identified to genus), centipedes,
millipedes, isopods, amphipods and mites were enumerated and their assemblages
described with multi- and univariate methods. Ant genera alone proved unable to distinguish
pasture from rainforest, and mites (identified only to oribatid or non-oribatid) proved
of limited use because these two groups were present in all samples in extremely high
numbers that overwhelmed the contributions of other arthropod groups. However, a coarse
taxonomic approach using five arthropod groups (ants, centipedes, millipedes, isopods,
amphipods) clearly discriminated between pasture and rainforest, and also arranged the
revegetated sites between these two extremes. Simple frequency scores based on the
presence/absence of these arthropod groups in each of three replicate subplots were sufficient
to achieve this separation of site types. Habitats created by close planting of trees
and mulching may accelerate invertebrate colonization and, thus, promote the rapid establishment
of processes and functions characteristic of developing rainforests.","","","Daniel Ingram","daniel.ingram12@imperial.ac.uk","Daniel Ingram",1,20,980,49

smallholder agriculture and were composed of forest-dependent species. Communities in regenerating forest
were intermediate between intact forest and agriculture, although much closer to intact forest. Generalised
Linear Model (GLM) modelling revealed that tree density and distance to the nearest intact forest had strong
positive and non-linear effects on the community composition and forest species richness of songbirds.
Simulations using these models showed that agroforestry programmes would not raise tree densities to
levels that would shift agricultural songbird communities towards forest communities. Current and bestcase
agricultural practices are therefore unlikely to contribute to the conservation of the songbird component
of forest biodiversity in this area.","","bird species summary daniel ingram.xls","Daniel Ingram","daniel.ingram12@imperial.ac.uk","Daniel Ingram",1,96,9024,94

Given that reserve expansion is unlikely, it is imperative that the conservation capacity of the matrix surrounding reserves is
enhanced. Here, we examine the habitat value of isolated pasture trees and patches of secondary regrowth in terms of their terrestrial and arboreal ant assemblages in both a wet and dry season. These simpliWed wooded systems increase species densities within the agricultural matrix and provide habitat for some forest ant species. Estimated species richness of arboreal ants was particularly low on isolated trees, highlighting an important limitation. This was not the case for terrestrial ants, which were particularly species rich under isolated trees. We also found that the inter-site variations in species densities and similarity to the forest ant assemblage for terrestrial and arboreal strata were not correlated, suggesting that responses to restoration may not be as uniform as often thought. This has important implications for the use of indicator taxa in suggesting the response of other taxa. In terms of species composition, neither secondary regrowth nor isolated trees were appropriate replacements for forest fragments, even though the studied forest fragments were small (1332 ha). The ant assemblages did not exhibit a seasonal change in composition. However, season inXuenced the contrast between habitats, with isolated trees being more distinct from pasture, and regrowth more closely resembling forests, during the wet season. Microclimatic variables indicate that the forests were least aVected by the tropical dry season, and this may contribute to their characteristic fauna. We conclude that even small forest patches make a unique contribution to landscape conservation and that, where reserves are limited, conscientious management of the landscape matrix may provide some species with suYcient new habitat to survive outside of reserve systems. These conclusions are inXuenced by both season and strata studied.","","","Daniel Ingram","daniel.ingram12@imperial.ac.uk","Daniel Ingram",2,18,1557,173

on three vertebrate communities, lizards, small mammals and birds, in an area of spiny forest
subjected to anthropogenic forest clearance. Spiny forest has high levels of endemism,

standardised trapping, time-constrained and timed species searches to assess species richness,

recorded a total of 70 species of birds, 14 species of mammals and 38 species of reptiles and

structure of all groups and identified loss of canopy cover as a driving factor behind
this. However, the response and sensitivity to clearing varied between groups and species.
Lizards (50%) and small mammals (40%) had the greatest decline in species richness in
response to clearing as compared to birds (26%), although birds showed the greatest shift
in community structure. The community in cleared areas contained more generalist and
introduced species that have wider geographic ranges and habitat preferences, than those
unique to the spiny forest.We found the first suite of species to suffer from forest clearance

A central focus in applied entomology is the role that habitat diversity plays in the
creation and maintenance of arthropod diversity. Researchers are increasingly exploring the
possibility that degraded landscapes such as mixed-used agricultural areas and rainforest
fragments might be used to supplement conservation strategies aimed at increasing arthropod
biodiversity. Here we present the results of a comparative biodiversity field study in the
Puriscal region on the Pacific slope of Costa Rica in a rural community characterized by
a mixture of secondary forest and farmland. The study compares beetle and spider diversity
among farmland, nearby tropical forest fragments, and weedy edge habitats. Diversity of
families of Coleoptera and Araneae pitfall catches were compared in each of these three
habitats, and quantitative similarity indices across habitats were calculated for the collected
specimens. Diversity among the three habitats was similar for beetles, but spiders were more
diverse in forest fragments than in edge habitats. Furthermore, composition of beetle families
was markedly different across all three habitats; spider families were similar only between
forest fragment and edge habitats. We discuss the implications of these findings, and suggest
further studies needed to address mechanisms underlying these patterns.","","","Daniel Ingram","daniel.ingram12@imperial.ac.uk","Daniel Ingram",2,47,1335,54

in agricultural mosaics in the Neotropics. However, understanding the relative importance of different
habitat factors and management practices at different scales for sustaining this biodiversity has proven
somewhat elusive. In addition, most such research has taken place in only a few fairly well-studied
landscapes, thus limiting our ability to infer broader patterns that might be transferred to unstudied
locales. This study expands the geographic breadth of prior research by evaluating bird and butterfly
assemblages in an agricultural landscape in the R´o Copa´n watershed of western Honduras. The study also
provides a systematic assessment of the relative influence of categorical and continuous habitat variables
across a range of scales likely to be significant for birds and butterflies. Overall, we recorded 145 tree
species, 139 bird species, and 119 butterfly species. Birds and butterflies displayed contrasting responses to
land cover: birds were most strongly associated with dense vegetation in broadleaf forests, forest fallows,
shade-grown coffee farms, and live fences, while butterflies were most abundant in live fences, pastures,
and riparian forests. Bird assemblages were heavily skewed toward common and non-forest-dependent
species, likely due to the young age and high disturbance level of forest plots. In contrast, butterfly
assemblages contained a substantial proportion of forest-dependent species, which were observed in
forests as well as pastures and live fences. Contrary to expectations, categorical land cover descriptors were
more effective at explaining faunal assemblage patterns than continuous habitat descriptors related to
vegetation and landscape context. In addition, plot scale (25100 m) habitat features had a greater influence
on faunal assemblages than did neighborhood scale (2003000 m) landscape composition or structure,
although differences in management intensity at the scale of the entire watershed (520 km) also exerted a
strong influence on conservation outcomes.","","Milder%2c bird species x traits matrix","Daniel Ingram","daniel.ingram12@imperial.ac.uk","Daniel Ingram",3,204,30911,439

coffee plantations are among the most important factors in montane cloud forest conversion

of local species richness, abundance of organisms could be determined by habitat
resource availability in agricultural landscapes. We compared abundance of Sturnira and
Artibeus bats (Phyllostomidae, Stenodermatinae), in shade coffee plantations and disturbed
cloud forest fragments, which represent habitats with different chiropterochorous plant
density. We also investigated the relationship between bat species abundance and food
plant richness, abundance and diversity. We captured 956 bats, 76% in cloud forest
fragments and 24% in shaded coffee plantations. Abundance of Sturnira spp. (small bats)
was greater in cloud forest than in coffee plantations, but Artibeus spp. (large bats)
abundance was similar in both habitats. Chiropterochorous plant abundance was positively
related with bat abundance for Sturnira spp., while chiropterochorous plant richness and
diversity were negatively related for Artibeus spp. This suggests that frugivorous bats with
different morphological and ecological characteristics respond differentially to anthropogenic
activities. For landscape management purposes, the maintenance and augmentation
of diverse food resources, for frugivorous bats with different foraging requirements in
coffee plantations, will benefit the resilience of bats to modification of their natural habitat.","","","Daniel Ingram","daniel.ingram12@imperial.ac.uk","Daniel Ingram",1,8,112,14

human impact on local bird communities in disturbed forests, but we still lack information on how bird species richness
and ecological processes respond to diff erent forest modifi cations present at a landscape scale. In a heterogeneous South
African landscape, we chose six types of indigenous scarp forest, diff ering in the intensity of human disturbance: continuous
natural forests and natural forest fragments in nature reserves, forest fragments in eucalyptus plantations, fragments
in the agricultural matrix, forest gardens and secondary forests in game reserves. In 36 study sites, we investigated the bird
community using point counts and observed the seed removal of birds at the native tree species Celtis africana . Species
richness did not diff er among the forest types, but abundance varied signifi cantly with most birds observed in fragments in
the agricultural matrix, forest gardens, and secondary forests. Th e higher bird abundance in these forests was mainly due
to forest generalists, shrubland and open country species whereas forest specialists were rarely present. Changes in species
composition were also confi rmed by multivariate analysis which clearly separated bird communities by forest type. Frugivore
abundance in C. africana was highest in natural forest fragments, fragments in the agricultural matrix, forest gardens
and secondary forests. Th e same trend was found for the estimated total number of fruits removed per C. africana tree,
though the diff erences among forest types were not signifi cant. Consequently, modifi ed forests seem to maintain important
ecological functions as they provide food sources for generalist species which may, due to their mobility, enhance natural
plant regeneration. However, we could show that protected forest habitats are important refugees for specialist species

The assemblage represented by these mammals is essentially composed of generalist species, which are common in degraded areas. Sugarcane plantations had the highest abundance, whereas pastures had the lowest species richness. Our results suggest that the loss of forest species can be related to the loss of native forest.

However, the impact of such land use change is still unknown. In this study we evaluated the spatial
temporal distribution and abundance of terrestrial non-volant small mammals on a recently converted
landscape whose matrix is formed by Eucalyptus plantations up to 3 years of age. From August 2007 to
July 2009 we carried out monthly sampling campaigns over a grid of 30 sampling units, formed by pitfall
traps covering both the landscape matrix of Eucalyptus plantations (n = 18) and legal conservation areas
of native vegetation (n = 7) and abandoned pastures (n = 5). A total of 1640 individuals from 14 species of
the orders Didelphimorphia (4 spp.) and Rodentia (10 spp.) were captured. However, only three species of
rodents (Olygorysomys flavescens, Oligoryzomys nigripes and Calomy tener) represented 81.8% of the total
amount. Eucalyptus plantations had a lower species richness and abundance than the abandoned pasture
and the remaining fragments of native vegetation. Although the present species are predominantly generalists,
there is clear distinction among environments in terms of their species composition and relative
abundance, which also present a pronounced time variation. The assemblage found in this study suggests
that silvicultural landscapes still have some conservation value, with species that seem to be resident at
the Eucalyptus plantations. Moreover, the presence of the native and abandoned pastures patches
imbibed in the Eucalyptus plantation matrix may increase the carrying capacity of such a silvicultural system
and these landscapes may play a role in maintaining local biodiversity.","","","Daniel Ingram","daniel.ingram12@imperial.ac.uk","Daniel Ingram",1,30,570,19

Sampling of soil macro-fauna was carried out in November, 2009 (short rain), April 2010 (wet rainy season) and September 2010 (dry season). Hand sorting of soil taken from 25 × 25 × 30 cm monoliths was used to extract all soil macro fauna greater than 2 mm body length. A total of 3,658 individuals comprising of 128 species mainly belonging to Phylum Arthropoda distributed across 3 classes and 13 orders, and Phylum Annelida with one order were collected across the four different land use systems. Termites and ants, and to a lesser extent coleopteran and earthworms were the most abundant groups. Significant effects of land use on macro-fauna abundance and species richness in all cases (p<0.001) were observed. There were significant interaction between Season*Region*Land use (p<0.01), Region*Land use (p<0.05) and Region*Protection*Land use (p<0.02).

Agriculture altered macro-fauna communities by declining individuals from Order Coleoptera, Hymenoptera and isoptera by > 50% and eliminating some Orders/Species. Human related disturbances outside protected area network declined macro-fauna density in grassland and woodland in dry region (65.07 vs. 39.74%) but increased the density by 107 vs. 340% in wet region.

We censused birds and measured vegetation structure at 27 stations in young (6–9‐yr old) actively and passively restored pasture and old growth forest at Las Cruces Biological Station in southern Costa Rica. During 481 10‐min point counts, we detected a high diversity—186 species— of birds using the restoration area. Surprisingly, species richness and detection frequency did not differ among habitats, and proportional similarity of bird assemblages to old growth forest did not differ between restoration treatments. Bird detection frequency was instead explained by exotic grass cover and understory stem density—vegetation structures that were not strongly impacted by active restoration. The similarity of bird assemblages in actively and passively restored forest may be attributed to differential habitat preferences within and among feeding guilds, low structural contrast between treatments, or the effect of nucleation from actively restored plots into passively restored areas. Rapid recovery of vegetation in this recently restored site is likely due to its proximity to old growth forest and the lack of barriers to effective seed dispersal. Previous restoration studies in highly binary environments (i.e., open pasture vs. tree plantation) have found strong differences in bird abundance and richness. Our data contradict this trend, and suggest that tropical restoration ecologists should carefully consider: (1) when the benefits of active restoration outweigh the cost of implementation; and (2) which avian guilds should be used to measure restoration success given differential responses to habitat structure.","","Reid 2012 BITR Natural History Data.csv","Daniel Ingram","daniel.ingram12@imperial.ac.uk","Daniel Ingram",1,27,4887,181

quantifying foraging guild composition. Understanding the ecological processes that
underpin functional diversity of birds in oil palm Elaeis guineensis landscapes is important
because different foraging guilds are likely to be influenced in different ways by land use
practices. We surveyed birds at 55 sites within oil palm landscapes and at 20 sites within
logged peat swamp forest, recording 208 species belonging to 19 foraging guilds. Oil
palm landscapes supported a lower abundance of insectivorous, granivorous and omnivorous
birds than did logged peat swamp forest despite the latter being severely degraded
due to intensive timber extraction. However, abundances of other groups of foraging
birds, such as raptors and wetland taxa, were higher in oil palm landscapes than logged
peat swamp forest. Frugivorous species were more abundant in smallholdings than plantation
estates, probably because of the presence of native trees. Foraging guild diversity
was explained by stand-level attributes such as stand age, vegetation cover, epiphyte persistence
and canopy cover. However, each foraging guild exhibited unique responses to
different oil palm management regimes and stand-level attributes. Only arboreal omnivores
and terrestrial frugivores were affected by the proximity of nearby natural forest.
This diversity of responses implies that the occurrence of particular avian foraging guilds
may not be a suitable ecological indicator of best-practice palm oil production. Our
study also suggests that multiple conservation measures will be needed in oil palm landscapes
irrespective of management regimes, including: (1) the maintenance of ground
layer vegetation cover; (2) the pruning of oil palm canopy to permit light penetration to
the ground layer; (3) re-vegetation of parts of oil palm landscapes with native trees;
and (4) retention of natural and/or secondary forest patches within the boundaries of

plantations are lacking. We investigated how anuran biological diversity differs between forest and

specific environmental factors. We hypothesized that biological diversity is lower in plantations and that
plantations support a larger proportion of disturbance-tolerant species than forest. We compared species
richness, abundance, and community composition between plantation and forest areas and between site
types within plantation and forest (forest stream vs. plantation stream, forest riparian vs. plantation riparian,
forest terrestrial vs. plantation terrestrial). Not all measures of biological diversity differed between
oil-palm plantations and secondary forest sites. Anuran community composition, however, differed greatly
between forest and plantation, and communities of anurans in plantations contained species that prosper
in disturbed areas. Although plantations supported large numbers of breeding anurans, we concluded the
community consisted of common species that were of little conservation concern (commonly found species
include Fejervarya limnocharis, Microhyla heymonsi, and Hylarana erythrea). We believe that with a number

fragile area that is under increasing pressure from agricultural production, thus threatening the provision
of ecosystem services, the integrity of these landscapes, and the rural communities who depend on
them. To address this issue, we evaluated the influence of common agricultural management practices
(cropping and livestock systems) vs. the Quesungual slash-and-mulch agroforestry system (QSMAS) on
diverse parameters of soil quality and function. We then used this information to identify soil invertebrate
bioindicators that represent key aspects of soil quality (chemical fertility, physical properties,
aggregate morphology, and biological functioning). In February of 2011 soil sampling was conducted on
six hillside farms near the town of Somotillo in western Nicaragua to assess soil properties and the abundance
and diversity of soil macrofauna within four management systems: (1) QSMAS, based on maize
production, (2) traditional maize cropping system with few trees (TC), (3) silvopastoral system with low
tree density (SP), and (4) secondary forest (SF), used as a reference. The conversion of forest to agriculture
demonstrated the greatest impact of management in this study. For example, SF presented significantly
higher diversity of soil invertebrate taxonomic groups than either TC or SP (P < 0.03), and demonstrated
the lowest level of soil compaction, significantly less than SP (P < 0.05). Additionally, SF demonstrated
the highest value of soil quality according to a synthetic indicator that integrates chemical, physical and
biological aspects of soil quality. Although overall soil quality under QSMAS was lower than SF, this system
demonstrated the highest abundance (number of individuals) of soil macrofauna, and appeared to
at least partially mitigate the negative consequences of forest conversion on soil functioning. Using the
Indicator Value Index, which ranks species according to their specificity and fidelity across sites, along
with farmer consultation we found seven indicator taxa of soil quality that could greatly facilitate future
evaluation of land management impacts by farmers and technicians in the region. We suggest that the
methodology applied is robust and adaptable to diverse agroecological contexts and would allow for
more rapid responses to evolving land use issues as they arise.","","","Daniel Ingram","daniel.ingram12@imperial.ac.uk","Daniel Ingram",2,144,10368,144

Fourteen species were not affected by fragmentation and eight had significantly increased abundance in pine plantations compared to continuous forest. Overall abundance in pooled and ground/understorey birds was higher in forest fragments and pine plantations compared to continuous forest.

Abstract for the scientific article previously mentioned is supplied instead.

During the last decades wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) populations have been progressively declining in the Iberian Peninsula as a result of several factors, namely habitat deterioration. Hence, habitat management has become one of the most commonly used management techniques to restore wild rabbit populations. To test the efficacy of some of these measures (creation of pastures, opening firebreaks) in rabbit populations, two managed (M1 and M2) and two control areas (C1 and C2) were selected in the Portuguese Southwest (SW) Coast. In each study area, the influence of habitat management was tested assessing temporal changes in rabbit abundance obtained from pellet counts and in rabbits diet through microhistological analysis of fecal pellets. Rabbit densities were higher in managed than in control areas (mean annual values: M11.08 pellets/m2; M21.60 pellets/m2; C10.69 pellets/m2; C20.40 pellets/m2). In general, Gramineae was the most consumed plant group throughout the year and in all study areas. In control areas, consumption of alternative species with low nutritive value (e.g., Cistus ladanifer) was observed, especially in summer. Our data suggest a positive influence of habitat management on rabbit populations since in managed areas individuals presented an overall higher abundance and a more nutritive diet. In addition, there was no evidence that sown species were consumed in detriment to naturally occurring grasses, suggesting that in Mediterranean semi-arid regions clearing vegetation inside the scrubland might be sufficient to improve habitat conditions for rabbits.","Figure 2.1, page 12Figure 2.32, page 24","","David Laginha Pinto Correia","dl2511@imperial.ac.uk","David Laginha Pinto Correia",1,18,18,1

We compared the community structure, as well as the alpha and beta diversity between two cover conditions (open and closed vegetation) that represent the impact of grazing within a habitat, and between habitat types (submountainous and crassicaule scrublands). From 576 samples we collected 75,605 dung beetles belonging to 20 taxa. While mean species richness and diversity were different between habitat types, cumulative species richness was not. The effects of grazing on vegetation structure influenced the cumulative species richness and diversity of dung beetles in the submountainous scrubland, where grazing has created land mosaics of a grassland matrix with scrubland patches. This was not the case in the crassicaule scrubland where the impact of grazing is not as evident. Beta diversity significantly responds to the effects of grazing on habitat conditions. We discuss the ecological factors that may promote these responses by landscape diversity components. We also identify the species that could act as useful indicators to monitor the effect of land management on biodiversity. Our results indicate cattle farming maintains a diversified land mosaic, and these areas support more diverse dung beetle ensembles than homogeneous areas of closed, shrubby vegetation cover. Thus, controlled grazing activity could certainly favour the conservation of dung beetle biodiversity and improve ecosystem functioning by maintaining dung decomposition rates.","Table 1, page 5","Data on feeding behaviour: Verdu 2007.xlsx (3rd sheet: ecology)","David Laginha Pinto Correia","dl2511@imperial.ac.uk","David Laginha Pinto Correia",1,4,80,20

protected against exploitation. In contrast to other Neotropical forest types, not much is known
about the effect of habitat disturbance on deciduous forest bird communities. In the present study,
we examine the effects of human disturbance on a deciduous forest bird community in the Andean
foothills of Bolivia. Bird community composition was determined by means of point count surveys
in three forest types, i.e. undisturbed deciduous and semi-deciduous forest, and disturbed forest
habitat. Habitat disturbance was estimated indirectly by measuring vegetation structure variables
in these forests. The effect of habitat disturbance was subsequently examined at bird community
level (species richness, species abundance and diversity indices) and functional group level (habitat
preference categories and foraging guild). Differences in community composition and reduced
species abundance could clearly be related to habitat disturbance. However, results also indicated
that sensitivity to disturbance varied among functional groups. Humid forest specialists showed the
strongest response to habitat disturbance, predominantly bark-gleaning insectivores, canopy
insectivores, understorey insectivores and ground-dwelling species, whereas dry forest specialists
were not affected by disturbance. The present study suggests that anthropogenic disturbance
negatively influenced the forest bird community in the investigated deciduous forest in Bolivia.
This may indicate that conservation of both deciduous and semi-deciduous forest remnants is
relevant for a diverse montane bird community in South America. Because various bird species
typical of deciduous forests may also be able to survive in partly disturbed forests, conservation
strategies should not only be focussed on the protection of pristine remnants but should also include
secondary forest edge zones.","Map: Figure 1","","David Laginha Pinto Correia","dl2511@imperial.ac.uk","David Laginha Pinto Correia",1,3,342,114

A total of twenty-seven species distributed in seven families was found. Greater abundance was registered in the plots of matrix two and capoeira three and the least in succession one. The richness was greater in matrix two, with the greater number of exclusive species. The abundance of anurans correlated significantly, with the average circumference at the breast height of the trees of the plots. The richness however correlated only marginally, with this  structural feature. The larger richness in plots of capoeira and matrix can be explained partially by the existence of temporary ponds and more structural heterogeneity is able constitute intermediary stages in a gradient of perturbation and this can increase the biodiversity.

facultatively were characteristic of cultivated habitats, whereas the opposite was true for grassland obligates and

attained relatively high densities in natural grasslands only. Some threatened species, such as the Ochre-breasted

No distance to the nearest edge of habitat supporting high diversity was set on Chichijima because it is an island where such high quality habitat does not exist.

SC1 04/03/2014 Added Geographic coordinates sent by the author.","Although large islands generally support a richer insect fauna than small islands, many large islands, which are more often inhabited, have lost numerous species because of human activities and introduced organisms. To clarify the consequences of endemic insect conservation on small islands near inhabited islands, we compared the species richness, abundance, and composition of two beetle groups (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae and Mordellidae) captured using Malaise traps among three islands (Chichijima, 24.0 km2; Anijima, 7.85 km2; Nishijima, 0.49 km2) in the oceanic Ogasawara (Bonin) Island group in the northwestern Pacific during JuneJuly 2006 and 2007. Chichijima, the largest island, is inhabited, while Anijima and Nishijima are not. The numbers of cerambycid and mordellid species previously recorded were positively correlated with island area. However, the total numbers of cerambycid and mordellid species we captured in Malaise traps were not correlated with island area because we were unable to collect many species previously documented on Chichijima. The numbers of cerambycid and mordellid species per trap did not differ significantly among islands and years, although the deviance was well explained by the island variable. We captured greater numbers of cerambycid and mordellid individuals on Chichijima than on Anijima and Nishijima, and the numbers of cerambycid and mordellid individuals per trap significantly differed among islands and between years. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that the species composition of cerambycids and mordellids differed among the three islands. Whereas endangered species were rarely captured on Chichijima, alien or non-endemic species were frequently collected. Cerambycid and mordellid beetles on Chichijima may have been deleteriously affected by recent forest disturbance and introduced organisms. Therefore, conserving insect fauna on uninhabited island refugia is important for preserving the insect diversity of the Ogasawara Islands.","Map - Fig. 1

In this setting, regrowth resulted from clearing for intensification of pastoral development. Regrowth (or rehabilitation to forest) was not a state sought by the landholders, but rather was an unsought consequence of management neglect or inaction. In most cases, cleared lands, regrowth and intact forests were subject to continuing grazing pressure, frequent fires and incursions by non-native plants (usually through deliberate introductions, then spread, of exotic pasture grasses, particularly gamba grass Andropogon gayanus).","CONTEXT: World-wide, primary forest is in decline. This places increasing importance on understanding the use by
biodiversity of regrowth (secondary) forest, and on the management of such regrowth.
AIMS: This study aimed to compare the terrestrial vertebrate assemblages in tropical eucalypt forests, regrowth in these
forests (following clearing for pastoral intensification) and cleared land without regrowth, to provide evidence for
developing management guidelines for regrowth vegetation in a region (the Daly catchment of the Northern Territory)
subject to increasing demands for land-use intensification.
METHODS: The terrestrial vertebrate fauna was surveyed consistently at 43 quadrats sampling forest, 38 sampling regrowth
and 19 sampling cleared land (formerly forest), and the faunal composition was compared with ordination and analysis of
variance. Further analysis used generalised linear modelling to include consideration of the relative importance of
disturbance (condition) of quadrats.
KEY RESULTS: Faunal assemblages in regrowth vegetation were found to be intermediate between cleared land and
intact forest, and converged towards the faunal assemblage typical of intact forest with increase in the canopy height of the
regrowth. However, even the tallest regrowth quadrats that were sampled supported relatively few hollow-associated
species. The management of fire, weeds and grazing pressure substantially affected the faunal assemblages of the set of
regrowth and intact forest quadrats, in many cases being a more important determinant of faunal attributes than was whether
or not the quadrat had been cleared.
CONCLUSIONS: In this region, regrowth vegetation has value as habitat for fauna, with this value increasing as the regrowth
structure increases. The convergence of the faunal composition of regrowth vegetation to that of intact forest may be
substantially affected by post-clearing management factors (including fire regime and level of grazing pressure and weed
infestation).
IMPLICATIONS: Regrowth vegetation should be afforded appropriate regulatory protection, with the level of protection
increasing as the regrowth increases in stature.","","","David Laginha Pinto Correia","dl2511@imperial.ac.uk","David Laginha Pinto Correia",3,370,44758,375

Quantitative surveys were carried out using the point-count method in three distinct forest types located in continuous forest with a mosaic of successional stages. One of these types can be considered primary forest while another secondary forest in an intermediate stage of regeneration and still a third in an early stage of regeneration. A total of 141 bird species were recorded in the three types, where 10 species were exclusive to the primary forest and 36 to the secondary forests. Despite the structural differences in the vegetation of the three areas, patterns of bird richness and abundance were very similar in the three areas sampled. We analyzed attributes such as size, occupancy in the upper and lower canopies, and forest and forest edge behaviors and eating habits. We did not find significant differences between the bird species in these attributes for the three forest types. The species occupancy potential was also analyzed in relation to forests in the secondary stage of regeneration. We found that 85% of species have potential to occupy secondary forests. The results indicate that the pattern found is associated with the structure of the continuous forest and the heterogeneity of environments making up the mosaic. The presence of recovering secondary forests within primary forests in mosaic form helps maintain the richness and abundance of Atlantic forest birds.","Table 1, page 45-50","Bocon 2012 - Data.xlsx","David Laginha Pinto Correia","dl2511@imperial.ac.uk","David Laginha Pinto Correia",1,3,423,141

consequent abandonment of large farmland areas in the Mediterranean region. We assessed the
response of species richness and composition, and species functional traits to decreasing land use
intensity in a Montado system, an agro-pastoral system characteristic of the Alentejo, Southern Portugal.
Additionally, we investigated whether plant functional types can be established based on the response to
decreasing land use intensity in these systems. Consistent with previous studies, species richness
decreased sharply after land abandonment, and this was associated with a strong turnover in species
composition from grazed to abandoned sites as the vegetation changed from herbaceous to shrub
dominated communities. Pronounced differences in functional traits were found for different
successional stages. Therophyte life form, short plant height, high specific leaf area (SLA), low leaf
dry matter content (LDMC) and small seeds with dispersal structures were dominant in grazed plots.
Within abandoned plots, chamaephytes dominated in plots abandoned for 1015 years and decreased in
favour of nanophanerophytes in plots abandoned for 2030 years. Plant height, LDMC and seed mass
increased with abandonment time while SLA decreased. Functional response groups sufficient to
describe vegetation change were identified combining life form and SLA. Therophytes with mediumSLA
were the dominant functional group in grazed areas, while nanophanerophytes with mediumor low SLA
were associated with later phases of abandonment. At intermediate stages of succession the dominant
group was chamaephytes with mediumSLA but functional diversity was highest as all the groups, except
hemicryptophytes with mediumSLA, were represented. These changes in functional composition can be
translated into effects on key ecosystem properties. The increase in LDMC indicates an increase in
flammability while trends in both LDMC and SLA suggest decreased decomposition, and thereby carbon
and nutrient cycling. These will need to be considered in combination with consequences for other
ecosystem properties for future management.","","Castro 2010.xlsx","David Laginha Pinto Correia","dl2511@imperial.ac.uk","David Laginha Pinto Correia",1,9,918,102

Forest restoration is likely to be more successful when it proceeds with an understanding of how native and exotic vertebrates utilize forest patches of different size. We used a system of forest fragments isolated by volcanic activity 153 years ago in Hawaii to examine how long-term fragmentation, as well as fragment size and structural features affect the richness of native and exotic bird species. The total number of bird species increased rapidly with forest fragment size, with most of the native species pool found in patches <3 ha. Smaller fragments were dominated by native bird species with several exotic bird species found only in the largest fragments, suggesting that exotic bird species in this landscape show greater area-sensitivity than native species. We used airborne scanning light detection and ranging (LiDAR) to assess whether fragment area was correlated with estimates of fragment vegetation volume as well as measures of tree height. Fragment area was highly correlated with vegetation volume, maximum tree height, and canopy height heterogeneity, and these variables were strong predictors of bird richness, demonstrating that remote sensing can provide key insights into the relationship between fragment structural attributes and biodiversity indicators. Overall, this work demonstrates the value of conserving small remnant mid-elevation forest patches for native birds in Hawaii. This work also provides insight into how newly created forest patches might be used by native and exotic bird species in Hawaii.","Taxa from Table 1, p 283.

Short-term changes were assessed during three consecutive years in plots previously exposed to different grazing pressures and compared to plots in long-term (3040 years) exclosures. Short-term cessation of grazing led in the short-term to an increase in relative biomass of annual crucifers and tall annual and perennial grasses, while biomass of annual legumes, annual thistles and short annual grasses decreased. Consequently, similarity increased between vegetation recently excluded from grazing and vegetation in long-term protected plots. Our research showed that in systems with high dominance of grasses and annual species, the rapid changes in plant species composition that occur after grazing cessation were associated with a fast recovery of the potential for biomass production to levels found in long-term protected plots, while litter decompositionrate did not change even after long-term cessation of grazing. Moreover, previous history of grazing did not affect plant litter decomposition, despite higher litter quality in grazed treatments.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of disturbance type on the specific richness and relative abundance of birds in the Reserva Provincial Parque Luro, La Pampa Province. In this reserve there are three sites of calden forest with different degree of disturbance, (tourism, burn forest, and less disturbed forest). The birds were sampled by point counts; with a total of eight points in each site. All point counts were carried out during the 2008 reproductive season (October to December). We registered a total of 36 bird species, 25 of them were resident and 11 migratory. The difference of relative abundance was marginally not signifi-cant between sites (F: 2.98; p<0.08), bird abundance was highest in the burnt area due to the presence of Zenaida auricu-lata, that uses this area for nesting. The specific richness was smaller in this area, while it did not show differences between the tourism and the less disturbed sites (F: 4.69; p<0.05). However, most of the species present in the tourism area were generalists or edge species. Elaenia parvirostris, considered an interior species of the caldén forest, was present in the less disturbed area and absent in the other two sites. Our result shows diversity decreases in burnt areas, while tourism areas are occupied by generalist or edge species.","Table 1, page 5","","David Laginha Pinto Correia","dl2511@imperial.ac.uk","David Laginha Pinto Correia",1,3,105,35

We present density estimates for 18 key bird species in old growth forest, advanced and early secondary growth and active cultivation within the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park in Palawan. Six species were not recorded in cultivation and the abundance of these and several others increased along the successional gradient from cultivation to old growth forest. Eleven species, including five endemics and three of four threatened species, had highest density estimates in old growth forest. However, several species had high density estimates in the heavily disturbed habitats and every habitat type held highest densities of at least one of the bird species. The commonest habitat association across the bird community was a preference for areas containing large trees, indicating the importance of retention of such trees in allowing suitable ground and understorey microhabitats to persist. Old growth forests have the highest conservation value for Palawans endemic birds and, while some species thrive in the anthropogenic habitats that occur within the Park, the present extent of cultivation and associated successional stages within its boundaries should not be increased. We caution against extrapolation of the abundance figures from the Park to the whole island but we suggest that population sizes for the threatened species are likely to be much greater than previously thought.

realistic conservation strategies, particularly in highly dynamic systems such as Mediterranean agricultural mosaics
that are subjected to intensive cultivation. We investigated these effects on the nocturnal bird species occurring in the

years. Shares of vineyards, scrubland, herbaceous cropland, water bodies, and roads significantly affected the composition
of the nocturnal bird community. Herbaceous cropland and olive groves, which covered 50% of the study area,
proved to be neutral for all species. Remnant patches of natural and semi-natural scrubland (around 10% of the study

Long-eared Owls, and Red-necked Nightjars. Vineyard (35% of the study area) had a negative influence on Eagle Owls,

apparently not related with the presence of nocturnal bird species and, second, that natural scrublands and water bodies
are key habitats for assuring the persistence of nocturnal birds in agricultural Mediterranean landscapes. Current
land planning focused toward land use intensification will likely increase the areas of habitats that are neutral or have

impacts (e.g. on biodiversity) that can be reduced with proper management. We assessed the value of
eucalypt plantations to favor habitat connectivity at the landscape scale by determining their ability to
provide habitat for species associated with the natural vegetation. For this purpose, we compared
diversity and composition of understory vegetation in low-management eucalypt plantations in young,
intermediate (ready for harvest) and mature stages with pine plantations, native forests and shrublands.
We estimated the true species richness with Chao2 estimators and compared among habitats the average
species richness (at two different local scales: per plot and per site), Shannon indices and biovolume of
herbs, shrubs and trees in the understory using ANOVAs or GLZs, depending on data distributions. Differences
among habitats in understory species composition and functional types were compared with PERMANOVA,
and were graphically represented using NMDS ordinations. At local scales, diversity tended to
be higher in native communities (native forests and shrublands) and lower in plantations (lowest in
intermediate eucalypt plantations). Diversity across all study sites was again lowest in eucalypt plantations
in intermediate age, but was relatively high in other plantations, due to a high species turnover in
young and mature eucalypt plantations. Eucalypt plantations were similar to shrublands in understory
species composition and functional types when young, becoming more distant to them when older,
and more similar to pine plantations and native forests. Native forests were the most distinctive community,
with pine plantations being the most similar to them. Native forests harbored the rarest species and
were also associated with seed dispersal by vertebrates (internally). Ant- and wind dispersal were the
most common in shrublands and eucalypt plantations. Given the prevalence of eucalypt plantations in
some regions, determining (and improving, if feasible) their ability to harbor biodiversity of native communities
becomes a crucial goal, in order to increase landscape connectivity and favor species persistence
at regional scales. In the study region, eucalypt plantations provide habitat for species typical of shrublands
when young but do not contribute significantly to the maintenance of the understory biodiversity
associated with native forests. Considering the distinctiveness of native forests, we favor protection and,
where feasible, restoration of native forests over managing eucalypt plantations for biodiversity to best
improve conservation outcomes.","Table 1 - GPS coordinates and patch size

We conducted bird point-count surveys combined with distance estimation. Breeding season bird community composition was more similar between control and logged forest in both the cloud forest and piedmont, than between the two elevations, probably because Neotropical bird communities change dramatically along elevational gradients. Within each elevation zone, community composition changed significantly between harvested and control forests. Both between and within each elevation zone no significant differences in bird density were detected. Similarly, when we analyzed bird density according to diet guilds no general pattern could be extracted. However, we found a significantly greater density of cavity nesters and lower of non-cavity nesters in control plots, probably because most trees that can develop suitable cavities were extracted in logged plots and these plots had a greater structural diversity enabling more nesting resources. Grouping species according to their nesting habitat requirements has rarely been used in the neotropics and other tropical and subtropical forests, but focusing management attention on cavity nesters might address the most sensitive portion of the avian community as well as other species dependent on trees likely to hold cavities.","Map - Figure 1Data - Table 3","Table 3","David Laginha Pinto Correia","dl2511@imperial.ac.uk","David Laginha Pinto Correia",1,4,428,107

The reduced-impact logging (RIL) is considered a less destructive method of timber harvesting, but there is a general lack of information about the effects on Amazonian invertebrates, including butterflies. We investigated the effect of RIL on fruit-feeding butterflies by comparing canopy and understory between an area under RIL and a control area without RIL. The canopy fauna is different and significantly richer than the understory fauna, showing that sampling only the lower strata underestimates the diversity of fruit-feeding butterflies. The effects of RIL were mainly detected in the understory butterfly assemblage, as significant differences were observed in species composition within this stratum. Effects of the RIL regime, which include tree cutting, skid trails and roads openings, are stronger in the understory than in the canopy, explaining the reported differences. Despite the detectable effects of RIL on the composition of fruit-feeding butterfly assemblages, the overall diversity was not affected. A similar pattern has been detected in many other groups, indicating that a noticeable part of the diversity of many taxa could be preserved in areas under RIL management.

invasive alien species. However, the resultant plant species loss per unit area cannot be quantified, as
the true richness of grassland have not been determined accurately and current estimates of richness are
generally based on once-off site visits. The aim of this study was to quantify and compare the species
richness of selected transformed and untransformed grasslands of tropical and temperate regions in South
Africa. The study sites were located in four grassland vegetation units: KwaZulu-Natal Coastal Belt
and Maputaland Woody Grassland (tropical), and Paulpietersburg Moist Grassland and Rand Highveld
Grassland (temperate).
Methods  Thirty-two plots of 10 × 10 m were sampled at the four sites, namely eight in each of the
vegetation units. At each site four plots were sampled in untransformed grassland and four in adjacent
transformed grassland. Thorough floristic sampling of each plot was undertaken three times during the
peak growing seasons.
Key results  Plant species richness was higher for untransformed grassland than transformed grassland,
and is higher than what was previously estimated. Species richness is not severely affected by alien
cover and richness, as species losses are made up by better adapted native and alien species entering the
transformed habitat. Rare species and habitat specialists are displaced. The type of transformation has a
pronounced effect on species richness.
Conclusion  Plant species richness of grassland is higher than previous estimates. Increasing alien
cover and richness reduces the species richness of certain grassland growth forms and replaces species of
conservation importance such as endemics.","Map - Figure 1","","David Laginha Pinto Correia","dl2511@imperial.ac.uk","David Laginha Pinto Correia",1,96,77856,811

Nocturnal birds were present in 97 % of the stations, where variables relative to the extent and configuration of land-use types were measured. The probability of Tawny Owl presence increased with increasing forest cover, the probability of Little Owl presence increased with increasing amount of arable land, whilst the probability of Eurasian Scops Owl and Long-eared Owl presence increased with increasing amount of open areas. The model of European Nightjar showed that the probability of presence increased with increasing amount of forest edge and scrubs. Our results suggest that heterogeneous agricultural landscapes may favour the coexistence of several nocturnal birds, since the different species are each associated with different land-use types.","","","David Laginha Pinto Correia","dl2511@imperial.ac.uk","David Laginha Pinto Correia",1,123,738,6

Here we propose a Footprint index for French Guiana, (northern Atlantic coast of South America) which sums up the expected and proven disturbances on biodiversity. The index was developed by superimposing geographical and human data, including human population densities, land use, settlements and camps, mining and forest activities, tracks, roads and rivers. The relevance of the index as a general measure of anthropic impact on large terrestrial fauna was estimated by investigating the structure of the large terrestrial vertebrate assemblages, including primates, large frugivorous birds, rodents and ungulates, in relation to the extent of disturbances. The abundance of large terrestrial fauna was assessed using the line-transect sampling method in 34 forest sites facing different disturbance levels, including hunting, logging and fragmentation, and consequently different footprint scores. A Self Organizing Map was used to combine species abundances and disturbance scores. It allowed us to rank species in accordance to their sensitivity towards disturbances, identifying the response of fauna to different concomitant threats. The index provided correct identification of sites with similar threats which proves it is a relevant estimator of human disturbance. In addition, the richness of animal communities and abundances of several seed dispersers and predators were negatively correlated to the index (e.g. large monkeys and frugivorous birds, r2 = 0.49, P\0.0001 and r2 = 0.48, P\0.0001, respectively), indicating its reliability in identifying areas where animal communities are disturbed. The index could, therefore, constitute a useful tool to identify areas where ecological processes supported by those species are expected to be disrupted, and where they are already disrupted. Furthermore, the footprint index can deal with lack of field data or with only partially valid information, and so may directly help land managers forecast and, hopefully, mitigate forthcoming impacts resulting from the development of human activities.","Map: Figure 1","","David Laginha Pinto Correia","dl2511@imperial.ac.uk","David Laginha Pinto Correia",1,35,455,13

Species responses to logging depend on a number of factors, many of which have not been studied in detail. These factors may include the natural forest conditions (forest types) under which logging impacts are investigated; but this question has so far remained unexamined. In a largescale replicate study we aimed at clarifying the relationship between logging and forest types on leaf litter frogs. We contrast three distinct and naturally occurring forest types, including wet evergreen, moist evergreen and semi-deciduous forests. Selectively logged sites were compared with primary forest sites for each forest type. We found that the response of frog communities to logging varies in different forest types. In the wet evergreen forest, richness was higher in logged forest than primary forest, while diversity measures were not different between logged and primary forest habitats. In the moist evergreen, richness and diversity were higher in selectively logged areas compared with primary forest habitats. In the semi-deciduous, logged forests were characterized by drastic loss of forest specialists, reduced richness, and diversity. These results indicate that the net effect of logging varies with respect to forest type. Forest types that are characterized by adverse climatic conditions (i.e., low rainfall and protracted dry seasons) are more likely to produce negative effects on leaf litter anuran communities. For comparisons of the impact of logging on species to be effective, future research must endeavor to include details of forest type.","Map - Figure S1

This study compared the species composition from five different physiognomies of Cerrado, and tested the hypothesis that the termite faunas of savannas and grasslands form a distinct group from that of forests. The study was conducted in the Parque Estadual da Serra de Jaraguá, state of Goiás, Brazil. Termites were sampled from two physiognomies of savanna, one natural grassland, one pasture, and one gallery forest. A transect with 10 parcels of 5x2 m was established in each physiognomy. The relative abundance was inferred by the number of encounters, termites were classified in feeding guilds, and the dissimilarity in the species composition between the physiognomies was calculated. A total of 219 encounters, of 42 species of two families were recorded. The most abundant feeding guilds were the humivores (98) and xylophages (55). The physiognomies with the largest number of species were rupestrian cerrado (23 species) and cerrado sensu stricto (21). The physiognomies had a similar species composition (less than 55% dissimilarity), mainly the natural open areas. The hypothesis of a distinct fauna of termites in forest vegetation was refuted. The termite fauna of gallery forest is very different from that of pasture, but most species also occur in natural open areas. The impact of pasture on the diversity and composition of termites seems to be significant, but the impact is even greater on the proportion of the feeding guilds, reducing the proportion of xylophages and intermediates.","Data: Table 1, page 5","Feeding Groups - Oliveira et al. 2013.xlsx","David Laginha Pinto Correia","dl2511@imperial.ac.uk","David Laginha Pinto Correia",1,5,210,42

cycle showed an increase in the detection of canopy frugivores and seed predators during
the peak of flower and fruit availability in primary forest, but failed to suggest that secondgrowth

conservation value of both secondary forest and plantations was low compared to conclusions

species occurrences and assemblage compositions. However, within forest habitats irrespective of
whether logged or unlogged, similarities in assemblage compositions of sites close to each other
underline the importance of geographic distance in shaping small mammal assemblages. In terms of
conservation management, it is imperative to incorporate the size and overall surrounding
environment of a forest into forest management concepts, and although not equivalent to areas of
primary forest, old regenerating secondary forest needs to be considered as an important component
for the preservation of small mammal species diversity. In contrast, oil palm plantations are clearly of
little or no importance for the conservation of the non-volant small mammal fauna and this habitat
may also act as an effective barrier to the dispersal of the small mammals.","Table 1Text","","Felicity Bedford","felicity.bedford@stcatz.ox.ac.uk","Felicity Bedford",1,4,48,12

cattle grazing due to the occurrence of a native shrub poisonous to livestock. Vegetation (floristic data and 22 habitat
variables) and vertebrate fauna (birds, mammals, reptiles) were sampled in 29 standardized 50 x 50-m quadrats in
the 2001 wet season, representing four treatments: sites burnt recently (within 2y) and grazed by cattle (4-8 ha
per livestock unit); sites unburnt (last burnt > 2y ago) and grazed; sites burnt recently and ungrazed; and unburnt
and ungrazed sites. Fire and grazing had a significant influence on vegetation: both grazing and fire reduced ground
cover (fire in grazed sites 51-23%, fire in ungrazed sites 68-39%) and increased the cover of forbs (8% in burnt
and grazed sites, 3% if ungrazed) and tussock grasses (20% in grazed and unburnt sites and 5% when ungrazed).
Grazing caused a shift in floristic composition from the perennial hummock grass Trioda pungens to tussock grasses
(e.g. A ristida spp., Enneapogon spp.), forbs (e.g. Phyllanthus spp.) and shrubs (e.g. Acacia spp.). Of the vertebrate groups,
birds responded more to fire effects (9 species), reptiles to grazing effects (6 species) and mammals to the interaction
(2 species). Species reacted to increases in bare ground (e.g. crested pigeon Ocyphaps lophotes, hooded robin Melanodryas

architecture( e.g. singing honeyeater Lichenostomus virescens, variegated fairy-wren Malurus lamberti). The clearest
example of an interacting effect was the cycle of complementary dominance between the rodents Pseudomydse licatulus

Tree dimensions and utilization by elephantwere recorded for 3082 individual trees across 22 transects (average length of 3 km and 10 m wide). Sixty per cent of the trees exhibited elephant utilization and 4% were dead as a direct result of elephant foraging behaviour. Each height class of tree was utilized in proportion to abundance. However, the size of the tree and the species influenced the intensity of utilization and foraging approach. Sclerocarya birrea was actively selected for and experienced the highest proportional utilization (75% of all trees). Interestingly, the proportion of large trees that were utilized and pushed over increased with distance from permanent water, a result which has implications for the provision of water in the KNP. We conclude that mortality is likely to be driven by a combination of factors including fire, drought and disease, rather than the actions of elephant alone. Further investigation is also required regarding the role of senescence and episodic mortality.","Figure 1 = Page 2Figure 2 and Table 1 = Page 4Figure 3 and 4 = Page 5Figure 5 = Page 6","","Gwilym Pask-Hale","g.pask-hale@nhm.ac.uk","Gwilym Pask-Hale",1,20,880,44

The occurrences of functional (life form, dispersion, etc.) and human-valued (current uses, potential threats, etc.) traits were compared. Current land uses outside protected areas have an unequal effect on the various components of plant diversity. Species richnesses and specific structures were all the more altered for woody species as agricultural pressure is high; conversely, they were maintained for herbaceous communities for which the proportion of wide-ranging species increased. The preservation of useful plant species on cultivated lands was obvious for woody species with edible fruits but less tangible for timber and service wood. It was deficient for species that furnish other non-wood products (e.g. leaves used as food or fodder), the conservation of which may be jeopardized where anthropic pressure is high. Given current land uses and dynamics,
maintaining conservation areas in land use planning is crucial in order to preserve ordinary biodiversity.","Figure 1 = Page 5

dwelling arthropods respond to fire disturbance despite the critical role these organisms play in nutrient cycling and other
biogeochemical processes. Following the incursion of a fire into a woodland savanna ecological reserve in Central Brazil, we
monitored the dynamics of litter-arthropod populations for nearly two years in one burned and one unburned area of the
reserve. We also performed a reciprocal transplant experiment to determine the effects of fire and litter type on the
dynamics of litter colonization by arthropods. Overall arthropod abundance, the abundance of individual taxa, the richness
of taxonomic groups, and the species richness of individual taxa (Formiciade) were lower in the burned site. However, both
the ordinal-level composition of the litter arthropod fauna and the species-level composition of the litter ant fauna were not
dramatically different in the burned and unburned sites. There is evidence that seasonality of rainfall interacts with fire, as
differences in arthropod abundance and diversity were more pronounced in the dry than in the wet season. For many taxa
the differences in abundance between burned and unburned sites were maintained even when controlling for litter
availability and quality. In contrast, differences in abundance for Collembola, Formicidae, and Thysanoptera were only
detected in the unmanipulated samples, which had a lower amount of litter in the burned than in the unburned site
throughout most of our study period. Together these results suggest that arthropod density declines in fire-disturbed areas
as a result of direct mortality, diminished resources (i.e., reduced litter cover) and less favorable microclimate (i.e., increased
litter desiccation due to reduction in tree cover). Although these effects were transitory, there is evidence that the
increasingly prevalent fire return interval of only 12 years may jeopardize the long-term conservation of litter arthropod

We do this by comparing savanna ant communities within the Territory Wildlife Park (TWP) near Darwin in the Australian monsoonal tropics, which has experienced a low incidence of fire over 25 years due to active fire exclusion, with those of adjacent (outside) sites experiencing the ambient fire regime of burning every 25 years. Ants were sampled using terrestrial and arboreal pitfall traps at 16 sites, eight each inside and outside TWP. More than 16 000 ants were recorded during the study, representing a total of 98 ant species from 30 genera. More species in total were recorded outside (90) than inside (74) TWP, but there was no difference in mean site species richness or abundance, and overall species composition was similar. All species recorded inside TWP are common and widespread throughout the savanna landscapes of the broader region, in the absence of active fire exclusion. Low fire frequency at the Territory Wildlife Park therefore does not appear to have enhanced regional ant conservation values. Our findings reinforce the importance of targeting fire regimes that are clearly linked to positive conservation outcomes, rather than assuming a need for maximum pyrodiversity.","Table 1 = page 3

Our results reveal that the stands of A. leiocarpa are in healthy states in fallows and in the park. In croplands, the absence of saplings gives evidence of a declining population. Nearly all individuals of A. leiocarpa were harvested in croplands and fallows, while the number of harvested individuals in the park was negligible. Intensity of debarking and chopping was tree size-specific. The sprouting ability significantly increased with higher chopping intensity. We conclude that despite the land-use impact and the intense harvesting, stands of A. leiocarpa are still well preserved due to the species life history (fast growing and high sprouting) and due to indirect positive influences of human activities by providing better environmental conditions for its recruitment. Thus, the population of A. leiocarpa is not at risk to over-harvesting and land-use even though it is not protected.","Figure 1 = Page 3Figure 2 = page 4Table 1 = page 5Figure 3 = page 5Figure 4 = page 6Table A1 = page 7","","Gwilym Pask-Hale","g.pask-hale@nhm.ac.uk","Gwilym Pask-Hale",2,179,179,2

Invasive species alter the composition and function of communities, threatening the conservation of important ecosystems worldwide. In savanna ecosystems, fire plays a key role by modifying biogeochemical cycles and shaping the composition and structure of vegetation communities. Although many studies have examined the long-term effects of fire frequency on grassland communities, few studies have examined the relationship between fire regime and woody species invasions.
Methods
The Serengeti ecosystem is an ecologically and economically valuable natural resource in East Africa whose conservation is currently threatened by a variety of factors, including invasive species. We determined the abundance of Maerua subcordata, a noxious woody shrub, in three different regions of the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. We then examined the influence of fire frequency, developed through the use of 7 years of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery, on M. subcordata abundance.
Important Findings
In all regions, burned transects had significantly greater abundances of M. subcordata compared to unburned transects. Furthermore, the number of times each transect burned from 2000 to 2006 had a significant positive effect on the abundance of
M. subcordata and the number of years since a transect last burned had a significant negative relationship with abundance. These results are particularly important as this species provides little forage value and is potentially toxic to wildlife and cattle. Additional studies are needed to determine the ecological consequences of increasing M. subcordata abundance, as the potential expansion of noxious shrubs into protected areas of important conservation status is of serious concern.","Figure 1 = Page 3

losses to affected farmers. In August 2011, such wildfires swept through the North West province of South Africa,
destroying large areas of grazing and farm infrastructure. There is little information available on how the regional
semi-arid rangelands respond to fire. In order to increase knowledge on short-term regeneration capacities of
burned rangelands, the recovery of grass phytomass, composition and diversity as well as the frequency distribution
of patch types (i.e. grass-, litter- and bare patches) were assessed in the growing season following the fire.
Burned and unburned sites were compared in two regional grasslands and one savanna type receiving between
480 and 700 mm rainfall y1. Fire significantly reduced phytomass production, and lowered the grazing capacity and
potential grazing days across vegetation types. In general, grass diversity, composition and relative frequencies
remained unaffected documenting an overall good regeneration potential of the grass sward. An increased proportion
of bare patches and decrease of litter indicated that the post-fire environment lost functionality with respect to
erosion control, nutrient cycling and water infiltration. Gained insights provide valuable baseline information for
future impact assessments and research into the fire dynamics of investigated vegetation types.","Figure 1 = Page 4Figure 2 = Page 5Table 1 = page 6Figure 3 = Page 6","","Gwilym Pask-Hale","g.pask-hale@nhm.ac.uk","Gwilym Pask-Hale",1,24,1200,50

dierences in land use. Ants were collected in undisturbed, mature forest, in an abandoned pasture,
in a young regrowth forest (situated in a former pasture area), and in an old regrowth forest
(established where mature forest was just cleared and abandoned). More ant species were found in
mature and old regrowth forest than in the abandoned pasture. By contrast, ant abundance tended
to decrease with forest maturity. Both pasture and young regrowth forest exhibited a distinct ant
species composition compared to mature forest, whereas species composition in the old regrowth
forest showed greater similarity to that of mature forest. In spite of dierences in fallow time between
former pasture areas and non-pasture areas, there is evidence that dierent land-management
practices do result in dierent rates of recovery of the ant forest fauna after land abandonment. In
any case, recuperation of the ground-foraging ant fauna appears to be faster than regeneration of the
woody-plant community. In this sense, regrowth forests may be valuable for the conservation of
ground-foraging ants and perhaps for other components of mature-forest leaf-litter fauna within the
context of a fragmented landscape.","","","Hollie Booth","hollie.booth@unep-wcmc.org","Hollie Booth",1,5,735,147

isms, particularly in the Neotropics where logging operations have increased dra-
matically in recent years. In this study we determined experimentally the eects of
selective logging of a central Amazonian forest on ground-living ants.
2. The experimental design consisted of three 4-ha replicated plots representing
control unlogged forest, forest logged 10  years prior to the start of the study
(1987), and forest logged 4  years prior to the start of the study (1993). The logging
operation removed 50% of the basal area of trees of commercial value, or about
eight trees per hectare. This resulted in a signi®cant decrease in canopy cover, and
an increase in understorey vegetation density in logged plots relative to controls.
3. Collection and identi®cation of ants from a total of 360 1-m2 samples of leaf-lit-
ter revealed 143 ant species, of which 97 were found in the control plots, 97 in the
plots logged in 1987, and 106 in those logged in 1993. Species richness, evenness
and mean abundance (ants m
ÿ2) per plot did not vary among treatments. Most of
the species found in the control plots were also present in the logged plots. How-
ever, population density of many species changed as a result of logging, an eect
that persisted for at least 10  years after logging. Species commonly found in sites
that were directly disturbed by logging (gaps and tracks) were rare in the undis-
turbed forest, as revealed by an additional collection of ants.
4. These results suggest that the persistence of ant assemblages typical of undis-
turbed forest is likely to depend on the amount of structural damage incurred by
logging. Thus management techniques that minimize logging impacts on forest
structure are likely to help maintain the conservation value of logged forests for
ground-dwelling ants. It is particularly important to minimize the extent of logging
roads and tracks created by heavy machinery because these areas appear more
prone to invasion by non-forest species.","","","Hollie Booth","hollie.booth@unep-wcmc.org","Hollie Booth",1,9,1287,143

biodiversity are poorly known. There is even less knowledge about the impacts of military training, a recent, but
rapidly expanding, alternative land use. We compare impacts of these land uses upon mammals, birds, reptiles and
frogs at a site in north-eastern Australia, with sampling from 24 quadrats stratified by four landscape positions (upper
slope to riparian) and three current land-use types (pastoralism, military training and undisturbed). Prior to
exclusion in 1967, the whole study area had been subjected to grazing over the course of approximately 100 years,
so differences observed strictly reflect responses to changed land use (largely cessation from grazing) over the period
of 32 years subsequent to the imposition of the present regime. The four classes of vertebrates showed contrasting
responses. Frog distribution was unrelated to land use, but strongly associated with landscape position. Reptiles
showed a very strong response to land-use type but not to landscape position. The total abundance and richness of
reptiles was greater in ungrazed (i.e. military and undisturbed) than in grazed quadrats. The total abundance and
species richness of birds varied strongly with landscape position but was unrelated to land use. However, many
individual bird species showed significant responses to land-use type, and bird species composition was significantly
related to both land-use type and landscape position. The richness of the mammal fauna was weakly related to
landscape position and not related to land-use type. A few individual mammal species showed significant responses
to either or both factors, but mammal species composition was significantly (albeit weakly) related only to land-use
type. With due regard to some interpretative constraints in the study design, and the history of the site prior to this
study, these results suggest that pastoralism leads to a substantial rearrangement of the vertebrate fauna, and
particularly so for reptiles and those mammals and birds associated with the ground and understorey layers. Given
the extent of pastoralism across the tropical savannas, these results suggest that this industry has contributed to major
and widespread change in the savanna fauna. In contrast to pastoralism, military land use (at least at the relatively
low intensity examined here) produced little change in vertebrate assemblages.","pp 316-317, Table 2 abundance data","","Hollie Booth","hollie.booth@unep-wcmc.org","Hollie Booth",1,3,123,41

studied, particularly in the tropics. We sampled beetles in three types of primary forest and two types of
disturbed forest habitats in eastern Thailand to assess the utility of pselaphine beetles as bioindicators of
forest disturbance. We simultaneously measured leaf litter mass, soil moisture, soil acidity and canopy cover
at each site to infer which environmental factors affect pselaphine beetle diversity and abundance. At each
site, pselaphine beetles were extracted from ten 1 m2 samples of leaf litter and soil with Tullgren funnels. We
sampled 1867 adult beetles representing six supertribes, 51 genera and 114 morphospecies; 7% of the genera
and 92% of the species were undescribed. Forest types differed significantly in species richness, abundance,
diversity and evenness. Primary forest had greater numbers of species and individuals, and higher diversity
indices (H′). Teak plantation and secondary forest had substantially fewer individuals and species of
pselaphine beetles. Species composition differed between primary and degraded forests. Canopy cover, soil
moisture, and leaf litter mass positively correlated with beetle species richness and abundance. Leaf litter
mass and soil moisture were the two most important factors affecting the diversity of pselaphine beetle
assemblages. Among the 114 morphospecies collected, 43 morphospecies were specific to two or three
habitats and 64 morphospecies were found only in a single habitat. Thus pselaphine beetles appear to have
rather narrow habitat requirements and their presence/absence was correlated with environmental differences.
These traits make pselaphine beetles a suitable bioindicator taxon for assessing forest litter diversity
and monitoring habitat change.","p 302, Figure 1 map of study sitesp 312 Appendix I abundance data","","Hollie Booth","hollie.booth@unep-wcmc.org","Sam Hill",1,5,570,114

Beetles were sampled through 12 mo using dung baited pitfall traps. A total of 18,073 dung beetles belonging to three subfamilies and 45 species were captured. The subfamily Scarabaeinae was the most abundant (99%) and species rich (89%). Fast-burying tunnellers (paracoprids) were the most dominant functional group. Catharsius sesostris, Copris nepos, and Heliocopris punctiventris were the three most abundant species, and had the highest contributions to dissimilarities between forests. With few exceptions, dung beetle abundance, species richness, and diversity were generally higher in larger forest fragments (100-150 ha) than in smaller ones (10-50 ha) and the nature reserve (1042 ha). Forest fragment size had a highly significant positive relationship with beetle abundance, but only when the nature reserve is excluded in the analysis. Dung beetle abundance and species richness showed direct weak relationships with litter depth (positive) and groundcover (negative) but not tree density, tree species richness, and fragment isolation distance. Dung beetle abundance and species richness were strongly correlated with monthly changes in rainfall. Results of this study indicate that forest fragments on agricultural lands in the Budongo landscape, especially medium-sized (100-150 ha) ones, represent important conservation areas for dung beetles.","p476 Table 1 sampling site characteristics

was calculated from density estimates. We compared production with offtake from three villages and used
catch-per-unit-effort as an independent measure of prey abundance. Most species were hunted unsustainably
in primary forest, leading to local depletion of the largest primates and birds. The estimated sustainable
supply of wild meat was higher for primary (39 kg · km−2 · yr−1) than secondary forest (22 kg · km−2 ·
yr−1) because four species were absent and three species at low abundance in secondary forests. Production
of three disturbance-tolerant mammal species was 3 times higher in secondary than in primary forest, but
hunting led to overexploitation of one species. Our data suggest that an average Amazonian smallholder
would require ≥3.1 km2 of secondary regrowth to ensure a sustainable harvest of forest vertebrates. We
conclude that secondary forests can sustainably provide only 2% of the required protein intake of Amazonian
smallholders and are unlikely to be sufficient for sustainable hunting in other tropical forest regions","","","Hollie Booth","hollie.booth@unep-wcmc.org","Hollie Booth",1,2,26,13

The line transect count was used to record species richness and abundance of butterfly communities in the different habitat types. For each habitat, the number of species and individuals, and indices of species richness, evenness and diversity of butterfly communities were calculated. The results indicated that species richness and abundance of butterfly communities were low in the natural closed forest, higher in the disturbed forest, highest in the forest edge, lower in the shrub habitat and lowest in the agricultural lands. The indices of species richness, evenness and diversity of butterfly communities were low in agricultural lands and natural closed forest but highest in the forest edge and shrub habitats. The families Satyridae and Amathusiidae have the greatest species richness and abundance in the natural closed forest, with a reduction in their species richness and abundance from the natural closed forest to the agricultural lands. Species composition of butterfly communities was different among five different habitat types (40%), was similar in habitats outside the forest (68%) and was similar in habitats inside the forest (63%). Diversity and abundance of butterfly communities are not different between the natural closed forest and the agriculture lands, but species composition changed greatly between these habitat types. A positive correlation between the size of species geographical distribution range and increasing habitat disturbance was found. The most characteristic natural closed forest species have the smallest geographical distribution range.","p16 Figure 1 map of sites Appendix S1 abundance data (file: ""Vu 2009 supp info"")","","Hollie Booth","hollie.booth@unep-wcmc.org","Hollie Booth",1,5,845,169

of the surrounding landscape matrix and treat all species equally. In our study, on
habitat fragmentation and the importance of landscape context, we expected that
habitat specialists are more affected by area and isolation, and habitat generalists more
by landscape context.
Location and methods The study was conducted in the vicinity of the city of Go¨ ttingen
in Germany in the year 2000. We analysed butterfly communities by transect counts on
thirty-two calcareous grasslands differing in size (0.035.14 ha), isolation index (2100
86,000/edge-to-edge distance 551894 m), and landscape diversity (ShannonWiener:
0.091.56), which is correlated to percentage grassland in the landscape.
Results A total of 15,185 butterfly specimens belonging to fifty-four species are recorded.
In multiple regression analysis, the number of habitat specialist (n ¼ 20) and
habitat generalist (n ¼ 34) butterfly species increased with habitat area, but z-values
(slopes) of the speciesarea relationships for specialists (z ¼ 0.399) were significantly
steeper compared with generalists (z ¼ 0.096). Generalists, but not specialists,
showed a marginally significant increase with landscape diversity. Effects of landscape
diversity were scale-dependent and significant only at the smallest scale (landscape
context within a 250 m radius around the habitat). Habitat isolation was not related
to specialist and generalist species numbers. In multiple regression analysis the density
of specialists increased significantly with habitat area, whereas generalist density increased
only marginally. Habitat isolation and landscape diversity did not show any
effects.
Main conclusions Habitat area was the most important predictor of butterfly community
structure and influenced habitat specialists more than habitat generalists. In
contrast to our expectations, habitat isolation had no effect as most butterflies could
cope with the degree of isolation in our study region. Landscape diversity appeared to be
important for generalist butterflies only.","Provided dataAppendix","","Helen Phillips","helen.phillips11@imperial.ac.uk","Helen Phillips",1,31,1674,54

In tropical forests, ground surveys are generally carried out by counting objects along straight lines. These counts require a strict compliance with the line-transect methodology before (proper design of the census), during (careful data collection) and after (accurate and correct data processing and analysis) the census itself. In addition, the major source of bias when estimating population size and/or trends comes from the extrapolation of estimates obtained in small sampling areas to the larger, and often incompletely known, distribution of the population. In the Kinabatangan floodplain (Sabah, Malaysia), helicopter surveys were useful in directly assessing the distribution of orang-utans and were a major advantage in the precise estimation of the size of the orang-utan population surviving in this region. Our survey showed that about 1100 orang-utans remain in the multiple-use forests of the Kinabatangan floodplain. These results provide new evidence on orang- utan adaptation to habitat disturbance and indicate the potential of the Kinabatangan multiple-use forests for orang-utan conservation.

among landscapes but there was no congruence between both taxa. The species
richness of butterflies was, for example, highest in sites located in a very large unburned

unburned isolate and once-burned forest. We also found substantial variation in the
habitat/vegetation structure among landscapes but this was mainly due to variation
between unburned and burned landscapes and variation among burned landscapes.
Both distance and environment (habitat/vegetation) contributed substantially to
explaining variation in the community similarity (beta diversity) of both taxa. The
contribution of the environment was, however, mainly due to variation between
unburned and burned landscapes, which contained very different assemblages of both
taxa. Sites located in the burned forest contained assemblages that were intermediate
between assemblages from sites in unburned forest and sites from a highly degraded
slash-and-burn area indicating that the burned forest was probably recolonised by
species from these disparate environments. We, furthermore, note that in contrast to
species richness (alpha diversity) the patterns of community similarity (beta diversity)
were highly congruent between both taxa. These results indicate that community-wide
multivariate measures of beta diversity are more consistent among taxa and more
reliable indicators of disturbance, such as ENSO-induced burning, than univariate

Calcareous grasslands harbour a high biodiversity, but are highly fragmented and endangered
in central Europe. We tested the relative importance of habitat area, habitat isolation, and landscape
diversity for species richness of vascular plants. Plants were recorded on 31 calcareous grasslands in the
vicinity of the city of Go¨ttingen (Germany) and were divided into habitat specialist and generalist
species. We expected that habitat specialists were more affected by area and isolation, and habitat
generalists more by landscape diversity. In multiple regression analysis, the species richness of habitat
specialists (n¼66 species) and habitat generalists (n¼242) increased with habitat area, while habitat
isolation or landscape diversity did not have significant effects. Contrary to predictions, habitat specialists
were not more affected by reduced habitat area than generalists. This may have been caused by
delayed extinction of long-living plant specialists in small grasslands. Additionally, non-specialists may
profit more from high habitat heterogeneity in large grasslands compared to habitat specialists. Although
habitat isolation and landscape diversity revealed no significant effect on local plant diversity, only an
average of 54% of habitat specialists of the total species pool were found within one study site. In

28/11/2013 HP1 data curation","1. There is considerable debate about whether tropical forests can be managed for tim- ber production and to conserve biodiversity. Few sustainable forestry systems have been evaluated adequately in this respect. Microchiropteran bats may be model taxa for this purpose. They are an important component of mammalian diversity, play key roles in forest dynamics and are indicators of disturbance in neotropical forests.
2. We investigated the effect of Trinidads periodic block system (PBS) on bat species diversity and community organization. PBS is a polycyclic system of selective logging with a 30-year harvesting rotation. We captured bats in primary forest and PBS-managed forest logged 33, 31, 21, 20 and 10 years previously.
3. Selective logging did not affect species diversity but did affect community structure. Frugivorous bats were significantly more abundant in logged forest whereas gleaning animalivores were more abundant in primary forest, suggesting that frugivores bene- fited and gleaning animalivores were adversely affected by logging.
4. The bat community showed evidence of recovery. The number of years since forest disturbance was positively correlated with the abundance and number of species of gleaning animalivores and negatively correlated with the proportional abundance of the most common species. Gleaning animalivores increased in abundance with forest regen- eration, whereas the community became less dominated by a single generalist frugivore. 5. Synthesis and applications. PBS selective logging appears to be compatible with the conservation of bat diversity. This provides evidence that neotropical forests can be managed for timber production in an ecologically sustainable way and that significant biodiversity conservation efforts can occur outside national parks and nature reserves in areas set aside for sustainable development. PBS could serve as a basic blueprint for sustainable forestry in the Guianan Shield where there are forests similar in species composition to those of Trinidad. Key attributes that could be adopted by many tropical countries to manage their forests in an ecologically sustainable way are a low intensity harvest, a long rotation and multiple controls on harvesting.","Table 1Table 3","","Helen Phillips","helen.phillips11@imperial.ac.uk","Helen Phillips",3,21,21,3

To evaluate the impact of coffee cultivation on epiphyte diversity, I surveyed vascular epiphytes on shade trees in nine different coffee plantations and compared records with those in four natural forests in central Veracruz, Mexico. Eighty-nine species occurred in coffee plantations, and 104 species occurred in natural forests. The number of epiphytic species in traditional polycultures with old shade trees, mostly of the genus Inga, was similar to that in forests, but plantations with small trees and sparse shade hosted fewer epiphytes than those with large trees. Epiphyte communities were, however, more homogeneous in coffee plantations than in forests, possibly because of a drier microclimate and the lack of large and long-lived trees. These results demonstrate the value of traditional polycultures for epiphyte diversity, show the importance of conserving large shade trees, and suggest that these coffee systems may not be suitable for all epiphytes.","","","Helen Phillips","helen.phillips11@imperial.ac.uk","Helen Phillips",1,13,1586,122

In particular, there is no information on the effects of widespread biomass extraction such as grazing and firewood collection. A study was carried out in Sariska Tiger Reserve in northern India, to investigate the effects of biomass extraction on forest vegetation composition, diversity and structure. Biomass extraction caused significant changes in forest vegetation structure and species composition in the tree layer but the extent of these changes varied across the three major vegetation types found in the Reserve. Anogeissus-dominated slope forest showed significantly lower mean canopy cover, tree density, tree basal area and height of trees in disturbed sites in comparison to undisturbed sites. Riparian forest showed lower mean canopy cover, tree basal areas and number of recorded tree species in disturbed sites. Scrub forest had lower mean canopy cover, tree basal area and tree height. There were fewer tall trees but greater number of short trees in disturbed sites of all three vegetation types. Girths of trees similarly shifted towards lower values in riparian and scrub forest. In Anogeissus-dominated forest, disturbed and undisturbed sites did not differ in proportions of trees in various girth-classes. Tree species richness was substantially lower in disturbed sites of Anogeissus-dominated and riparian forest in comparison to undisturbed sites, but was not affected by disturbance in scrub forest. Understorey species richness was higher in disturbed sites of all three vegetation types but understorey changed structurally only in Anogeissus-dominated forest. Overall tree and understorey species composition was significantly different between disturbed and undisturbed sites of Anogeissus-dominated forest, but was unchanged in scrub and riparian forest. Observed changes in vegetation structure, diversity and composition of the different vegetation types due to biomass extraction have implications for biodiversity conservation in tropical dry forest ecosystems, and need to be addressed in future forest management planning.","Acquired data","","Helen Phillips","helen.phillips11@imperial.ac.uk","Helen Phillips",2,60,150,5

and continuous forest unaffected by ENSO-induced disturbance in addition to
logged and unlogged landscapes in unburned forest. The relative abundance of
endemics was significantly higher in unlogged forest than logged forest and significantly
higher in unburned forest than burned forest. Rarefied species richness of

selectively logged than unlogged forest. In contrast, rarefied species richness of
range-restricted species was highest in continuous forest, intermediate in unburned
isolates, and lowest in burned forest. Only two individuals of a single Bornean
endemic species were found in all the burned forest. Although species richness was
higher in all range categories in continuous forest than in unburned isolates and
in burned forest, the difference was most pronounced for range-restricted species.
Logging and ENSO-induced fires thus have contrasting effects on range-restricted
species. While both increase the relative abundance of widely distributed species at
the expense of range-restricted species, only ENSO-induced disturbance lowers the
rarefied number of restricted range species. Our research highlights the threat that
severe ENSO events pose to geographically restricted classes of biodiversity.","","","Helen Phillips","helen.phillips11@imperial.ac.uk","Helen Phillips",1,6,24,4

The objectives were to compare assemblages in relation to forest type and use, to elucidate the value of forest plantations for biodiversity conservation and to identify indicator species for specific forest habitats. Arthropods were collected over an 11-month period, using standardized sets of traps (pitfall, emergence, Malaise and flight intercept traps). Nine different habitats were studied, including natural and degraded forest, forest plantations (Tectona grandis and Senna siamea) of different age, and isolated forest fragments. Our analysis focused on detritivorous and xylophagous arthropods but also included ground beetles and heteropterans, totalling 393 species. We found no differences in species richness among natural and degraded forest habitats in the centre of the reserve (Noyau central). Outside of the Noyau central, species richness was highest in old teak plantations and isolated forest fragments and lowest in young teak and fuelwood plantations. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) separated three main groups: (1) natural forest, (2) degraded forest and young plantations, and (3) old plantations and isolated forest fragments. Multiple regression of DCA scores of the first two axes on environmental variables identified one natural and three disturbance-related predictors of arthropod assemblages in Lama forest: soil type (texture), canopy height, naturalness (proportion of Guineo-Congolian plant species) and understorey vegetation cover. We identified 15 indicator species for six different forest habitats. The highest numbers were found in abandoned settlements and old teak plantations. b-diversity was similar among the three DCA ordination groups (degraded forest excluded). Values for b-diversity were relatively high, suggesting that all major forest habitats contribute significantly to regional species pools and should therefore be protected. To enhance arthropod diversity, we propose that management practices in Lama forest should aim to encourage the development of species-rich understorey vegetation of the Guineo-Congolian phyto- geographical region.","Acquired data","","Helen Phillips","helen.phillips11@imperial.ac.uk","Helen Phillips",1,36,14148,393

Secondary forests growing on cleared lands and tree plantations are becoming
increasingly widespread land-uses in the tropics. Previous studies are divided on the
conservation importance of these habitats for tropical forest butterflies.
2.
We use a robust sampling design, accounting for both seasonality and vertical
stratification, to examine fruit-feeding butterflies (Nymphalidae) in patches of
secondary forest and
Eucalyptus
plantation 23 orders of magnitude larger than those
previously sampled.
3.
We recorded 10 587 butterflies and 128 species in 3200 trap-days. Species richness
was highest in primary forest and lowest in plantations, while butterfly abundance showed
the opposite response. All habitats were distinct in terms of community structure.
4.
There was a significant interaction between habitat and season based on richness and
abundance metrics, although not based on community structure. Secondary forest
exhibited higher observed richness than primary forest in the peak of the dry-season,
but not at other times of the year. This observation could explain the lack of consensus
in previous studies, as those reporting higher richness in secondary forest only sampled
during the dry-season.
5.
In general, habitat quality appeared to be more important than the surrounding
landscape in determining butterfly community structure. However, the community
structure of the strong-flying Charaxinae was related to the amount of primary forest in
surrounding landscape. There was very poor congruence between the response patterns
of richness and abundance among different butterfly subfamilies.
6.
Linear regressions between resource availability and butterfly abundance showed a
strong influence of leaf phenology in both primary and secondary forest, but no influence
of fruit phenology.
7.
Synthesis and applications
: A lack of seasonal replication and small sampling sizes
may have led previous studies to over-emphasize the conservation importance of
secondary forest and plantations for butterflies. We show that these habitats are significantly
poorer than primary forest in terms of number of species, and hold distinct butterfly
communities. Although quantifying the number of species restricted to primary
forest remains difficult, these results cast doubt on the presumption that secondary
habitats will provide refuge for many of the species being lost through deforestation. We
therefore strongly urge measures that prioritize the conservation of remaining primary
forests where they still exist.","","","Helen Phillips","helen.phillips11@imperial.ac.uk","Helen Phillips",1,3,269,129

potential value of tropical agroforests for the conservation of biodiversity. Traditional,
shaded agroforests may support high levels of biodiversity, for some groups even
approaching that of undisturbed tropical forests. However, it is unclear to what extent
forest fauna is represented in this diversity and how management affects forest fauna in
agroforests. We studied lower canopy ant and beetle fauna in cacao agroforests and forests
in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, a region dominated by cacao agroforestry. We compared
ant and beetle species richness and composition in forests and cacao agroforests and
studied the impact of two aspects of management intensification (the decrease in shade tree
diversity and in shade canopy cover) on ant and beetle diversity. The agroforests had three
types of shade that represented a decrease in tree diversity (high, intermediate and low
diversity). Species richness of ants and beetles in the canopies of the cacao trees was
similar to that found in lower canopy forest trees. However, the composition of ant and
beetle communities differed greatly between the agroforest and forest sites. Forest beetles
suffered profoundly from the conversion to agroforests: only 12.5% of the beetle species
recorded in the forest sites were also found in the agroforests and those species made up
only 5% of all beetles collected from cacao. In contrast, forest ants were well represented
in agroforests, with 75% of all species encountered in the forest sites also occurring on
cacao. The reduction of shade tree diversity had no negative effect on ants and beetles on
cacao trees. Beetle abundances and non-forest ant species richness even increased with
decreasing shade tree diversity. Thinning of the shade canopy was related to a decrease in
richness of forest ant species on cacao trees but not of beetles. The contrasting responses of
ants and beetles to shade tree management emphasize that conservation plans that focus on
one taxonomic group may not work for others. Overall ant and beetle diversity can remain
high in shaded agroforests but the conservation of forest ants and beetles in particular
depends primarily on the protection of natural forests, which for forest ants can be complemented
by the conservation of adjacent shaded cacao agroforests.","","","Helen Phillips","helen.phillips11@imperial.ac.uk","Helen Phillips",1,15,3795,253

By sampling 16 sites evenly distributed in four habitat categories (continuous mature and secondary for- est and large and small secondary forest fragments), we investigated how harvestmen (Opiliones), which represent the third largest order of arachnids and have been poorly studied in tropical forests, are affected by habitat quality and quantity. Richness and abundance of rare species were strongly affected by habitat quality (first axis of principal component analysis on forest structure), increasing in less disturbed/mature forests.

Detrended correspondence analysis revealed that just one species increased in abundance in fragments, while several
others were associated with continuous and/or mature forest and that harvestman composition did not vary between large and small fragments. Our results suggest that harvestmen (1) are strongly affected by habitat quality and quantity, probably because, compared to other arthropod groups, they are relatively uniform in some relevant biological aspects (nocturnal predators dependent on microclimatic conditions that present low vagility); (2) are probably more indicative of intermediate-level disturbances, given the absence of species associated with highly-disturbed areas.","Figure 1Table 1Acquired data","","Helen Phillips","helen.phillips11@imperial.ac.uk","Helen Phillips",1,16,544,34

patterns of land use in terms of species richness and the percentage
of species restricted to primary forest (varying from 5% to 57%),

in response patterns was very weak when evaluated using
abundance or species richness data, but much stronger when using
metrics based upon community similarity. Our results show that,
whereas the biodiversity indicator group concept may hold some
validity for several taxa that are frequently sampled (such as birds
and fruit-feeding butterflies), it fails for those exhibiting highly
idiosyncratic responses to tropical land-use change (including
highly vagile species groups such as bats and orchid bees), highlighting
the problems associated with quantifying the biodiversity
value of anthropogenic habitats. Finally, although we show that
areas of native regeneration and exotic tree plantations can
provide complementary conservation services, we also provide
clear empirical evidence demonstrating the irreplaceable value of
primary forests.","","","Helen Phillips","helen.phillips11@imperial.ac.uk","Helen Phillips",6,17,863,590

decreased by 44% in burned forest. Drought also affected sun bear fruit trees in
unburned primary forest, with elevated mortality rates for the duration of 2 years,
returning to levels reported as normal in region in the third year after the ENSO
event. Mortality in unburned forest near the burn-edge was higher (25±5% of trees

in an overall tree mortality of 78±11% (10 cm DBH) 33 months after the fire event.
Disturbance due to fires has resulted in a serious decline of fruit resources for sun

conservation value of human-dominated countryside. The characteristics of the countryside
that promote biodiversity preservation remain poorly understood, however, particularly at the
fine scales at which individual farmers tend to make land use decisions. To address this
problem, we explored the use of a rapid remote sensing method for estimating bird community
composition in tropical countryside, using a two-step process. First, we asked how finegrained
variation in land cover affected community composition. Second, we determined
whether the observed changes in community composition correlated with three easily
accessible remote sensing metrics (wetness, greenness, and brightness), derived from
performing a tasseled-cap transformation on a Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus
image. As a comparison, we also examined whether the most commonly used remote sensing
indicator in ecology, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), correlated with
community composition.
We worked within an agricultural landscape in southern Costa Rica, where the land
comprised a complex and highly heterogeneous mosaic of remnant native vegetation, pasture,
coffee cultivation, and other crops. In this region, we selected 12 study sites (each ,60 ha) that
encompassed the range of available land cover possibilities in the countryside. Within each
site, we surveyed bird communities within all major land cover types, and we conducted
detailed field mapping of land cover.
We found that the number of forest-affiliated species increased with forest cover and
decreased with residential area across sites. Conversely, the number of agriculture-affiliated
species using forest increased with land area devoted to agricultural and residential uses.
Interestingly, we found that the wetness and brightness metrics predicted the number of
forest- and agriculture-affiliated species within a site as well as did detailed field-generated
maps of land cover. In contrast, NDVI and the closely correlated greenness metric did not
correlate with land cover or with bird communities. Our study shows the strong potential of
the tasseled-cap transformation as a tool for assessing the conservation value of countryside
for biodiversity.","Acquired data","","Helen Phillips","helen.phillips11@imperial.ac.uk","Helen Phillips",1,67,11189,167

There was no significant difference in number of recorded species or bird abundance between disturbed and undisturbed sites. However, bird species diversity was significantly lower in disturbed sites in comparison to undisturbed sites. Overall, bird species composition also differed significantly between disturbed and undisturbed sites. Nine of 38 locally abundant bird species (23.6%) showed significant selection for either disturbed or undisturbed habitats. Of these nine species, seven chose undisturbed habitats and two chose disturbed. All seven species adversely affected by disturbance are primarily insectivorous. Canopy cover, tree basal area and height of trees were significantly lower in disturbed sites in comparison to undisturbed sites. In both habitats, bird species composition was significantly dependent on these components of altered vegetation structure.

Partial Mantels tests confirmed that there were no significant residual effects of tree species composition on bird composition after the effects of vegetation structure were accounted for.

To evaluate frugivorous butterflies as indicators of forest disturbance in the
Brazilian Atlantic Forest.
Location
The study area is located in the municipality of Cotia, São Paulo State,
south-eastern Brazil (23°35′−23°50′S, 46°45′−47°15′W).
Methods
Sampling was done at four sites inside a large forest block, the Morro
Grande State Reserve, and in five forest fragments in an adjacent fragmented landscape.
Butterflies were sampled with portable traps, baited with a fermented mixture
of banana and sugar cane juice. Sampling was carried out during the period most
favourable for the capture of frugivorous butterflies in south-eastern Brazil.
Results
All richness-related results indicated no effect of forest fragmentation on the
frugivorous butterfly guild, concurring with the suggestion of appreciable resistance
of Atlantic Forest butterflies to habitat modification. However, species composition
discriminated between the two landscapes, indicating that fragmentation may have
effects beyond simple species richness. When species were analysed individually,
clear patterns of distribution emerged, with some species that were very abundant in
the fragmented landscape being practically absent in the continuous landscape, and
vice versa. This pattern seems consistent even for some subfamilies.
Main conclusion
Our findings support the usefulness of the frugivorous butterfly
guild as a biological indicator of forest disturbance effects in one of the world’s most
threatened ecosystems.","Table 1, Map","","Helen Phillips","helen.phillips11@imperial.ac.uk","Helen Phillips",2,18,18,2

This work compares the species richness, dominance and evenness of small non-volant mammals between logged and unlogged forests, and assesses whether assemblage variability (b-diversity) is similar between forest types.
Location Southeast Asia, northern Borneo (Sabah, Malaysia), Sunda-shelf.
Methods We surveyed species-rich assemblages of small non-volant mammals in three unlogged and three logged forests for 2 years. At each forest site, we sampled a permanently marked transect and two additional sites in three trapping sessions. All analyses were performed at both levels to include the effects of local abundances and point estimates, separately from the relative abundances of species on a more regional scale.
Results We trapped a total of 1218 individuals of 28 species. Eleven common species accounted for 95% of all captures. Species richness and diversity were significantly higher in unlogged forest (27 species) than in logged forest (17 species). This was mainly attributable to the smaller number of rarely recorded species in logged forest (five compared with 16 in unlogged forest, with a total of fewer than 10 captures). However, all common species were present in both logged and unlogged forests, and our analyses revealed similar patterns of dominance, evenness and fluctuations in abundance. Hence overall assemblage composition in multivariate space did not differ greatly between forest types. Assemblages of Muridae and Tupaiidae showed similar population fluctuations in space and time, indicating that the ecology of these taxa may be partially driven by the same environmental factors.
Main conclusions Although species were distributed patchily within sites, analyses at local and regional scales revealed similar patterns in diversity and assemblage variability, suggesting that effects of forest modification did not differ extensively locally and regionally, but had a profound effect on rare species. Our results emphasize the importance and conservation value of logged forest stands that are able to hold a large proportion of the small mammals also found in unlogged forests. Rare and more specialized species are more vulnerable to forest degradation than commonly caught species, resulting in the complete loss, or a decrease in numbers, of certain groups, such as arboreal small mammals and Viverridae.","TextAcquired data","","Helen Phillips","helen.phillips11@imperial.ac.uk","Helen Phillips",1,18,504,28

During 90,720 net-m-h of sampling, we captured 3789 bats of five families; of these 3764 were phyllostomids representing 44 species, 23 genera, and three feeding guilds. We focus on the 24 most abundant species of phyllostomids. In terms of abundance, frugivores dominated assemblages in all habitat types and seasons. Eight species consistently responded to habitat conversion, two species consistently responded to season, two species responded consistently to both habitat and season, and five species responded to habitat conversion in a season-specific manner. Frugivores and nectarivores were abundant in areas that had been converted to agriculture, which suggests that these bats are resilient to extant levels of disturbance and may be important in promoting secondary succession. However, this result may be scale- or context-dependent. If habitat conversion continues and dramatically reduces the areal extent and increases fragmentation of mature forest, then a complex metacommunity dynamic may characterize the region and source populations of bats may become threatened or extirpated locally.","Figure 1Supplemental files","","Helen Phillips","helen.phillips11@imperial.ac.uk","Helen Phillips",1,15,780,52

at study sites with water-logged soils than at sites where soils did not exhibit hydromorphic
properties. The hypogeic ant assemblage recovered more slowly than the epigeic

1.
Secondary and plantation forests are becoming increasingly widespread in the tropics. A recent
meta-analysis on the impacts of land-use change on tropical forest dung beetles concluded that
regenerating forests can be effective in helping to offset species loss following deforestation. However,
our understanding of the extent to which these results can be generalized to new locations
remains very poor.
2.
We attempted to overcome many of the design limitations that characterize previous studies by
collecting spatially independent dung beetle samples from primary, secondary and
Eucalyptus
plantation forests in north-east Brazilian Amazonia across a large quasi-experimental landscape
that minimized confounding edge and fragmentation effects.
3.
We recorded 9203 dung beetles, comprising 85 species. Species richness was significantly higher
in primary forest and the majority of species were more abundant there than elsewhere, whereas
secondary and plantation sites harboured an impoverished subset of primary forest species.
4.
Our data illustrate the low value of tropical secondary and plantation forests for dung beetles in
our study area, and our conclusions are more pessimistic than those of earlier studies.
5.
Because of differences in the order of species rank-abundance and rank-biomass patterns,
re-coding community data from abundance to biomass significantly altered the analytical weight of
individual species in determining community patterns. Larger bodied beetles were more prone to
local extinctions and abundance declines and this effect was consistent both within and between
genera.
6.
Synthesis and applications
. Our study demonstrates that secondary and plantation forests in a
large neotropical landscape host exceptionally impoverished dung beetle communities. Furthermore,
the depletion of beetle abundance combined with a reduction in average body mass in converted
forests is likely to have detrimental consequences for the maintenance of dung beetle-mediated
ecosystem services in these habitats. Differences in biogeographical and landscape context, and the
influence of common limitations in sampling design, may explain why many other studies have
painted a more optimistic picture of the conservation value of anthropogenic habitats. In the
absence of further evidence we caution strongly against the claim that forest regeneration schemes

has become a key tool in tropical rainforest conservation. One of the main  and least

both into disturbed and undisturbed habitats, frugivorous birds facilitate forest regeneration.
This study focuses on the tolerance of a frugivorous bird community to anthropogenic
habitat disturbance within the broader context of natural forest regeneration with conservation
purposes. It was carried out in the tropical cloud forest of Costa Ricas Talamanca
Mountains. Bird community response and tolerance to habitat disturbance was assessed
by comparing bird presence and densities along a disturbance gradient, ranging from open
pastures to closed mature forests. Birds were censused along nine transects applying the
variable width line transect procedure. Forty relevant frugivorous bird species were
observed during 102 h of survey time. Densities were calculated for 33 species; nine species
responded negatively to increasing level of disturbance and nine others positively. Results
indicate that large frugivores are generally moderately tolerant to intermediate, but intolerant
to severe habitat disturbance, and that tolerance is often higher for medium and small
frugivores. It appears that moderately disturbed habitats in tropical cloud forests are highly
suitable for restoration through natural regeneration aided by frugivorous birds. Due to a
lack of large forest seed dispersers, severely disturbed habitats appear less suitable.","Email from author, data from authors.","","Helen Phillips","helen.phillips11@imperial.ac.uk","Helen Phillips",1,9,828,92

From 100%-area inventories of big-leaf mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla) covering 204 ha or more at eight logged and unlogged forest sites across southern Brazilian Amazonia, we report generally higher landscape-scale densities and smaller population-level mean diameters in eastern forests compared to western forests, where most commercial stocks survive. Density of trees 􏰁20 cm diameter varied by two orders of magnitude and peaked at 1.17 ha􏰀1. Size class frequency distributions appeared unimodal at two high-density sites, but were essentially amodal or flat elsewhere; diameter increment patterns indicate that populations were multi- or all-aged. At two high-density sites, conventional logging removed 93–95% of commercial trees (􏰁45 cm diameter at the time of logging), illegally eliminated 31–47% of sub-merchantable trees, and targeted trees as small as 20 cm diameter. Projected recovery by commercial stems during 30 years after conventional logging represented 9.9–37.5% of initial densities and was highly dependent on initial logging intensity and size class frequency distributions of commercial trees. We simulated post-logging recovery over the same period at all sites according to the 2003 regulatory framework for mahogany in Brazil, which raised the minimum diameter cutting limit to 60 cm and requires retention during the first harvest of 20% of commercial-sized trees. Recovery during 30 years ranged from approximately 0 to 31% over 20% retention densities at seven of eight sites. At only one site where sub-merchantable trees dominated the population did the simulated density of harvestable stems after 30 years exceed initial commercial densities. These results indicate that 80% harvest intensity will not be sustainable over multiple cutting cycles for most populations without silvicultural interventions ensuring establishment and long-term growth of artificial regeneration to augment depleted natural stocks, including repeated tending of outplanted seedlings. Without improved harvest protocols for mahogany in Brazil as explored in this paper, future commercial supplies of this species as well as other high-value tropical timbers are endangered. Rapid changes in the timber industry and land-use in the Amazon are also significant challenges to sustainable management of mahogany.","Table 1Table 2","","Helen Phillips","helen.phillips11@imperial.ac.uk","Helen Phillips",1,8,8,1

and spatial autocorrelation were determined for populations in four habitats: continuous
forest, forest fragments, pastures adjacent to fragments and isolated pastures. We predicted
longer but less frequent pollen movements among increasingly isolated trees. This pattern
would lead to lower outcrossing rates for pasture trees, as well as lower genetic diversity

followed these expectations, with the shortest pollen dispersal among continuous forest
trees (240 m), moderate distances for fragment (343 m) and adjacent pasture (317 m) populations,
and distances of up to 2.3 km in isolated pastures (mean: 557 m). Variance around
pollen dispersal estimates also increased with fragmentation, suggesting altered pollination
conditions. Outcrossing rates were lower for pasture trees and we found greater spatial
autocorrelation and genetic structure among their progeny, as well as a trend towards lower
heterozygosity. Paternal reproductive dominance, the pollen contributions from individual
fathers, did not vary among habitats, but we did document asymmetric pollen flow between
pasture and adjacent fragment populations. We conclude that long-distance pollen dispersal

Spiders are one such group of invertebrate predators that are known to be sensitive indicators of environmental change in tropical ecosystems. The present study assesses the spider community structure and responses to rainforest fragmentation and degra- dation and conversion to shade-coffee plantations in the Anamalai hills, southern Western Ghats, India. Ten rainforest fragments ranging in size from 11 ha to 2,600 ha under varying levels of degradation within the Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary and private lands of the Valparai plateau, and two shade-coffee plantation sites were sampled for spiders using visual searches along time-constrained belt transects between January and May 2005. Within a total sampled area of 5.76 ha, 4,565 individual spiders (4,300 detections) belonging to 156 morphospecies within 21 families and 8 functional groups were recorded. The estimated total number of understorey spider species in the study area was 192 (±5.15 SD) species, representing around 13% of the total number of spider species so far described from India. Overall spider density, species richness, and species density showed no trend in relation to fragment area across all sites. Specific comparisons among undisturbed sites indicated however that high altitude sites had fewer species than mid-altitude sites and fragments had fewer species than relatively larger continuous forest sites. In contrast to the lack of trend in overall species richness and abundance, species composition changed substantially in relation to habitat alteration and altitude. Cluster analysis of Bray-Curtis similarities among sites in spider species composition revealed four distinct clusters: high altitude undisturbed sites, mid-altitude disturbed sites with an undisturbed mid altitude site, mid-altitude highly disturbed sites with a disturbed site, and shade- coffee plantation sites. Spider species, such as Psechrus torvus and Tylorida culta, that contributed significantly to the dissimilarity between undisturbed and disturbed rainforest sites, and rainforest and shade-coffee sites were identified that serve as useful indicators of habitat alteration.","Acquired dataAppendix","","Helen Phillips","helen.phillips11@imperial.ac.uk","Helen Phillips",1,8,1248,156

As human population size increases, demand for natural resources will increase. Logging pressure related to increasing demands continues to threaten remote areas of Amazonian forest. A harvest protocol is required to provide renewable timber resources that meet consumer needs while minimizing negative effects on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Reduced-impact logging (RIL) may be a viable option to achieve these goals.
2. Effects of RIL (18 m3 ha1) and forest physiognomy were assessed for populations of bats from Amazonian terra firme forest in Brazil at 2042 months postharvest. 3. Based on 64 512 meter-hours of netting, 1468 bats were captured representing 47 species, 30 genera, four families and five feeding ensembles. Five species (one nectarivore and four frugivores) responded to management in a consistent manner: four were more abundant in logged forest and one was more abundant in undisturbed forest. Ten species (one nectarivore, two gleaning animalivores and seven frugivores) responded to forest physiognomy in a consistent manner: nine were more abundant in closed-canopy sites and one was more abundant in gaps. Three species (all frugivores) exhibited idiosyncratic responses to management that were contingent on physiognomy.
4. Using qualitative measures (changes in status from common to rare, or from present to absent), RIL elicited negative responses from 16 species, mostly rare taxa. After accounting for differences in total number of collected individuals, control forest harboured seven to 15 more rare species than did forest subjected to RIL.
5. Synthesis and applications. In the short term, RIL generally did not negatively affect populations of abundant bats. In contrast, reductions in abundance or local extirpation in response to RIL generally characterized uncommon or rare species. Arrangement of RIL sites in a matrix of undis- turbed forest may allow sourcesink dynamics to mitigate effects of RIL on rare or sensitive species and enhance sustainability at a regional scale.","Acquired data","","Helen Phillips","helen.phillips11@imperial.ac.uk","Helen Phillips",1,46,2530,55

to biodiversity is agricultural expansion into native tropical ecosystems.
Tropical agriculture, particularly intensive agriculture,
often supports few native organisms, and consequently has been
largely overlooked in conservation planning; yet, recent work in
the Neotropics demonstrates that tropical agriculture with certain
features can support significant biodiversity, decades after conversion
to farmland. It remains unknown whether this conservation
value can be sustained for centuries to millennia. Here, we
quantify the bird diversity affiliated with agricultural systems in
southwest India, a region continuously cultivated for>2,000 years.
We show that arecanut palm (Areca catechu) production systems
retain 90% of the bird species associated with regional native
forest. Two factors promote this high conservation value. First, the
system involves intercropping with multiple, usually woody, understory
species and, thus, has high vertical structural complexity
that is positively correlated with bird species richness. Second, the
system encompasses nearby forests, where large quantities of leaf
litter are extracted for mulch. The preservation of these forests on
productive land traces back to their value in supplying inputs to
arecanut cultivation. The long-term biodiversity value of an agricultural
ecosystem has not been documented in South and Southeast
Asia. Our findings open a new conservation opportunity for
this imperiled region that may well extend to other crops. Some of
these working lands may be able to sustain native species over
long-time scales, indicating that conservation investments in agriculture
today could pay off for people and for nature.","Acquired data","","Helen Phillips","helen.phillips11@imperial.ac.uk","Helen Phillips",1,30,3420,114

Sampling was conducted during the wet season 2005, using three light-traps at 15 sites within areas of primary forest, secondary forest and Eucalyptus urograndis plantations in northern Brazilian Amazonia. The Jari study region provides one of the best opportunities to investigate the ecological consequences of land-use change, and this study is one of the first to examine patterns of diversity for a neotropical moth assemblage in a human-dominated landscape in lowland Amazonia. We found that the three moth families responded consistently to disturbance in terms of abundance and community structure but variably in terms of species richness, in a manner apparently supporting a life-history hypothesis. Our results suggest that secondary forests and Eucalyptus plantations can support a substantial level of moth diversity but also show that these forest types hold assemblages with significantly distinct community structures and composition from primary forest. In addition, the ability of these converted land-uses to support primary forest species may be enhanced by proximity to surrounding primary forest, an issue which requires consideration when assessing the diversity and composition of mobile taxa in human-dominated landscapes.","Figure 1Table 2Appendix 1","","Helen Phillips","helen.phillips11@imperial.ac.uk","Helen Phillips",1,15,45,3

Pitfall trapping was conducted at 22 sites in a montane region of central Peru during April and November/December of 2002. Sites included primary and secondary forest, shade- coffee, regenerated forest and open farms (mainly with banana, yuca, and corn). Ordination techniques indicated that beetle assemblages in forests, regenerated forest and coffee were relatively similar. However, assemblage compositions in forested areas differed even at similar altitudes under the influence of biogeographical factors, and the assemblages at disturbed sites (farms/coffee) were influenced by beetle dispersal from adjacent forests. During dry months, when beetle activity is low, communities at all habitat types tended to converge because fewer unique species were recorded in forests at that time and habitat/ season generalists were dominant. Preliminary results also indicate that beetles in shady crops such as bananas responded to plant growth: as the banana canopy closed-in, pro- ducing more shade, open-habitat specialists retreated and forest/shade specialists invaded the sites. Chronosequence data at two of the sites demonstrate the rapid and dramatic changes in species richness and assemblage composition caused by deforestation. As forests become increasingly fragmented, and open farms continue to expand, dung beetles will become more restricted to the remaining fragments and reserves. In the mosaic landscape studied here, shade crops, like coffee, act as habitat and corridors for many dung beetle species. Small farm size and the consequent magnitude of edge effects, likely contributed to beetle movement between habitat types and determined the apparent gen- eralist nature of many of the dung beetle species in this study.","Table 1Table 4Figure 1","","Helen Phillips","helen.phillips11@imperial.ac.uk","Helen Phillips",1,20,1260,63

Fifteen forest plots had, however, cumulatively more species than a random selection of 15 nonforest (coffee home garden and plantation) plots, even if the 2 plot types complemented each other in terms of habitats for forest plants.

Therefore, researchers frequently sample selected taxa that they believe reflect general biodiversity patterns. Usually, these studies focus on the congruence of a diversity (the number of species found per sampling unit) between taxa rather than on b diversity (turnover of species assemblages between sampling units). Such approaches ignore the potential role of habitat heterogeneity that, depending on the taxonomic group considered, can greatly enhance b diversity at local and landscape scales. We compared a and b diversity of four plant groups (trees, lianas, terrestrial herbs, epiphytic liverworts) and eight animal groups (birds, butterflies, lower canopy ants, lower canopy beetles, dung beetles, bees, wasps, and the parasitoids of the latter two) at 15 sites in Sulawesi, Indonesia, that represented natural rain forest and three types of cacao agroforests differing in management intensity. In total, we recorded 863 species. Patterns of species richness per study site varied strongly between taxonomic groups. Only 1317% of the variance in species richness of one taxonomic group could be predicted from the species richness of another, and on average 1218% of the variance of b diversity of a given group was predicted by that in other groups, although some taxon pairs had higher values (up to 76% for wasps and their parasitoids). The degree of congruence of patterns of a diversity was not influenced by sampling completeness, whereas the indicator value for b diversity improved when using a similarity index that accounts for incomplete sampling. The indication potential of a diversity for b diversity and vice versa was limited within taxa (720%) and virtually nil between them (04%). We conclude that different taxa can have largely independent patterns of a diversity and that patterns of b diversity can be more congruent. Thus, conservation plans on a landscape scale need to put more emphasis on the high heterogeneity of agroforests and the overarching role of b diversity shaping overall diversity patterns.","Acquired data","","Helen Phillips","helen.phillips11@imperial.ac.uk","Helen Phillips",5,75,5715,381

We censused a range of forest vertebrate species including large canopy-dwelling and terrestrial birds, three primates, one rodent and one tortoise. Two 4 km transects at each site were repeatedly surveyed during the wet season of 2008 to derive population density estimates on the basis of a cumulative survey effort of 416 km. RIL had ended within 16 months, and sites had been subjected to a mean extraction rate of 3.9 m3 ha1 , equivalent to only 1.1 trees ha1 . Three of the 15 vertebrate species examined here exhibited significantly different abundances at forest RIL sites, two of which were negative. Large frugivores such as primates were less abundant in sites subject to RIL, whereas smaller frugivores, granivores, folivores and insectivores were more common in logged sites. We are unable to reliably distinguish between responses of different taxonomic groups, since robust abundance metrics could only be estimated for four mammal species. Despite this, species traits including dietary guild, body mass, home range size and vertical stratification of forest use are used to explain varying responses. Our findings suggest that responsible reduced-impact logging practices in neotropical forests can be considered as a relatively benign form of forest management that can coexist with the requirements of both local economies and biodiversity conservation. However, our study sites experienced comparably low extraction rates, and detrimental effects such as hunting were low. Our results therefore provide an opportunity to scrutinise the effects of best practice logging systems, though do not necessarily represent typical circumstances across tropical forests.","","","Helen Phillips","helen.phillips11@imperial.ac.uk","Helen Phillips",2,24,468,39

semi-natural habitats across Europe. This can cause immediate loss of species but also

from different trophic levels. Present-day species richness of long-lived vascular plant
specialists was better explained by past than current landscape patterns, indicating an
extinction debt. In contrast, short-lived butterfly specialists showed no evidence for an
extinction debt at a time scale of c. 40 years. Our results indicate that management

It is important to document changes in the population sizes of species to justify and implement
conservation programmes. This is often hampered by the absence of historical population count
data, particularly for tropical animal species.
2. Here, we developed a predictive habitat distribution model (PHDM) for the army ant Dorylus
wilverthi, a keystone species of Central African rainforests. We applied the model to forest cover
data in western Kenya from 1913 to 2003 in order to estimate changes in the distribution and population
size over the last century. The model was based on a large data set including abundance data
of 51 repeatedly monitored 500 mtransects in forest and non-forest habitats.
3. Forest cover within 1400 m of the transect lines explained 58%of the variation in abundance of
D. wilverthi. The model predicts that the colony abundance of the army ant exponentially increases
with increasing forest cover and that colonies are absent from landscapes with less than 11%forest
cover.
4. Applying the PHDMto historical and recent forest cover data predicts a 52%decline in the population
size of D. wilverthi (from 2801 to 1346 colonies) between 1913 and 2003. Under a worst-case
scenario in which the forest area is reduced to the current national nature reserves, the population
size would decrease to fewer than 300 colonies, which is probably too low to ensure the long-term
survival of the species.
5. Synthesis and applications. Our study demonstrates that the application of a PHDM on landcover
change time series data may give valuable insights into changes in the population size of species
for which no historical population count data are available. Using this approach, we revealed a
significant decline in population size of the army ant D. wilverthi over the last century. High protection
status should be applied to all of the remaining forest area to prevent the population becoming
regionally threatened and to facilitate long-term conservation of this keystone species in Kenya.","","","Helen Phillips","helen.phillips11@imperial.ac.uk","Helen Phillips",1,37,74,2

the diversity of saproxylic beetles, focusing on species turnover among mature woodland
types. We surveyed five woodland types that represented the heterogeneity of the parks
woodland habitats. Beetles were collected using window traps over a period of 20 months.
The Jaccard Similarity Index was used as indirect value of beta diversity among woodlands
and to test the relation between species turnover and geographical distance. We also
identified the contribution of species turnover to landscape diversity by using a partitioning
model. Moreover, the presence of mixed woodlands (more than one tree species) allowed
us to attempt to valorise the effect of tree species (coupled with their historical management)
on species turnover among woodlands. Finally, we looked for different saproxylic
beetle preferences for habitat and tree species using an indicator value method. We found
that saproxylic beetle species composition varied significantly among the studied woodlands.
The variation in species turnover was independent from the distance among
woodlands, which suggested that beetle dispersal abilities could not explain this high
turnover. Tree species within woodlands were a key factor that increased diversity turnover
in woodlands and, consequently, the diversity of the park. Moreover, we found saproxylic
beetle species that had different habitat and tree species preferences. We conclude that
woodland heterogeneity (highly affected by woodland composition) seems to be the
driving force for saproxylic beetle diversity in this protected area.","Data tables, and supplementary material","","Helen Phillips","helen.phillips11@imperial.ac.uk","Helen Phillips",1,5,1135,227

Some transects bordered riparian reserves and oil palm where that was the case, traps in RR were labelled as primary forest and those in teh oil palm were labelled as plantation. Some traps were removed from the excel form as theyhad been destroyed (NAs in data given by author).","Agricultural expansion and intensification are major threats to global biodiversity,
ecological functions, and ecosystem services. The rapid expansion of oil
palm in forested tropical landscapes is of particular concern given their high
biodiversity. Identifying management approaches that maintain native species
and associated ecological processes within oil palm plantations is therefore a
priority. Riparian reserves are strips of forest retained alongside rivers in cultivated
areas, primarily for their positive hydrological impact. However, they can
also support a range of forest-dependent species or ecosystem services. We surveyed
communities of dung beetles and measured dung removal activity in an
oil palm-dominated landscape in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. The species richness,
diversity, and functional group richness of dung beetles in riparian
reserves were significantly higher than in oil palm, but lower than in adjacent
logged forests. The community composition of the riparian reserves was more
similar to logged forest than oil palm. Despite the pronounced differences in
biodiversity, we did not find significant differences in dung removal rates
among land uses. We also found no evidence that riparian reserves enhance
dung removal rates within surrounding oil palm. These results contrast previous
studies showing positive relationships between dung beetle species richness
and dung removal in tropical forests. We found weak but significant positive
relationships between riparian reserve width and dung beetle diversity, and
between reserve vegetation complexity and dung beetle abundance, suggesting
that these features may increase the conservation value of riparian reserves. Synthesis
and applications: The similarity between riparian reserves and logged forest
demonstrates that retaining riparian reserves increases biodiversity within oil
palm landscapes. However, the lack of correlation between dung beetle community
characteristics and dung removal highlights the need for further research
into spatial variation in biodiversityecosystem function relationships and how
the results of such studies are affected by methodological choices.","Provided by author, also available online at:

forests or conifer plantations, on ant species richness (i.e., the number of species) and species composition, ant assemblages from five old-growth forests (more than 120 years), four second-growth forests (3070 years) and three conifer plantations (3040 years) were compared in the Shimanto River Basin, Shikoku, southwest Japan. The number of ant species collected totaled 39. The number of ant species from the old-growth native forests, second-growth native forests and conifer plantations was 1020, 1520 and 1115, respectively. The overall ant species richness had not been affected by forest conversion. However, correspondence analysis (CA) showed that the ant species composition was markedly different between old-growth forests and converted forests (second-growth forests and conifer plantations). The species richness of woodland specialists was greater in the old-growth forests, and open-habitat specialists and habitat generalists dominated the converted forests. The impacts of forestry on ant assemblages were of a long duration. Ant assemblages of the second-growth forests under regeneration for 4070 years after logging were still distinct from those of old-growth forests. Careful management of second-growth forests bordering old-growth remnants would be essential to prevent the invasion of open-habitat species of ants into the interior of old-growth forests.","Abundance and location data provided separately by author","","Hannah White","hannah.white11@imperial.ac.uk","Hannah White",1,12,468,39

The joining of eight Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries to the EU will re-structure agriculture there. One of the main threats is the intensification of farmland management. Can agri-environmental programs balance the expected decline in bird assemblages of the CEE countries if farming will be intensified?We studied this question by comparing bird assemblages of 42 extensively and intensively grazed paired fields in three regions of Hungary (alkali steppes and meadows in Central Hungary and alkali steppes in Eastern Hungary). Bird assemblages varied significantly across regions and grazing intensity. Intensively grazed sites showed a higher species number and diversity, but lower densities than the extensive sites. This is probably the consequence of higher landscape diversity of intensive sites, which included farm buildings, shelters, wells and other structures. Several bird species, mainly with European conservation concern, showed contrasting responses to grazing intensity in the three regions, including key grassland species (black-tailed godwit Limosa limosa, redshank Tringa totanus, skylark Alauda arvensis and corn bunting Emberiza calandra). Therefore, threat and sensitivity to grassland characteristics are correlating. Although many of the declining species ofWestern Europe are still abundant in Hungarian grasslands, our results project the threat of the expected intensification. This study showed that it is not possible to provide a general grassland management scheme that will favour all bird species in all regions of Hungary. In the process of integrating to the EU and re-structuring agriculture, the establishment of scientifically sound schemes is urgent.","Abundance data provided by authorLocation data same as Korosi et al.

models, which predict how evolved traits limit species membership within assemblages depending on existing abiotic or biotic constraints, as a tool to explain how species move from a regional species pool into a restored community. Two often untested assumptions of these models, however, are that species traits can reliably predict species broadscale distribution and that the effects of traits on community membership do not vary between restored and remnant habitats. The goals of this study were to determine whether combinations of ecological traits predispose moth species toward recolonization of restored prairies and to assess the degree to which restored prairies contain moth assemblages comparable with prairie remnants. In 2004, we collected 259 moth species from 13 tallgrass prairie remnants and restorations in central Iowa. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to identify significant combinations of ecological traits that were shared by groups of moth species. Logistic regression was then employed to test for significant effects of the trait combinations on the frequency of prairie sites occupied by moth species. PCA partitioned moth traits into four axes that explained a total of 81.6% of the variance. Logistic regression detected significant effects for all four PCA axes on the fraction of sites occupied by moths. Species frequently filtered from the regional species pool into prairies were those that had long flight periods and were multivoltine, displayed a feeding preference for legumes but not other forb families, and were regionally abundant but relatively small in body size. Ordination revealed significant differences in moth communities among prairies, suggesting that species traits and habitat characteristics likely interact to create observed patterns of species recolonization of restorations. Thus, the optimal approach to restoring the lepidopteran fauna of tallgrass prairies may involve locating prairie plantings adjacent to habitat remnants.","Abundance data provided separately by author

For each land use
type, bird composition, diversity, and abundance were recorded for 2 years in 99 plots in three sampling units (each 4500 ha). A habitat gradient defined by canopy structure (grasslands to savannas to forests) was influenced by land use, so 300 plots were used to characterize simultaneous variation in bird communities along land use and habitat gra-
dients. At broad scales (aggregate of 33 plots covering 4500 ha) suburbs supported the lowest bird richness and diversity and rural landscapes the most, with reserves slightly
below rural. Although reserves were like rural lands in diversity of bird communities, they supported more species of conservation concern, particularly of grasslands and savannas. Differences among land use types varied with habitat structure. Suburbs, rural lands, and reserves had similar forest bird communities, but differed in grassland and savanna bird communities. The extensive rural forests are important for the region’s forest birds. Subur- ban grasslands and savannas had low shrub abundance, low native bird richness and high non-native bird richness and abundance. However, total bird richness and diversity were as high in suburban as in rural and reserve plots because high native richness in suburban for- ests and high non-native species richness in suburban grasslands and savannas compen- sated for lower native richness in suburban grasslands and savannas. Bird conservation here and in the Midwest USA should protect rural forests, expand grasslands and savannas in reserves, and improve habitat quality overall.","p. 529 Figure 1 map of study sites

To encourage and inform the conservation of snakes in these regions, I examined snake species diversity and abundance during 2 years of a mark-recapture study at 22 sites located in six American tallgrass prairie preserves in northern Illinois, USA. I emphasized landscape-scale relation- ships after accounting for covariance with environmental factors at both finer (microhab- itat) and broader (regional) scales. A total of 120 snakes representing seven species was captured using drift fence arrays associated with funnel traps and sheet metal cover. The low numbers and diversity of snakes captured, when compared to historic evidence, indicate that since the 1930s Midwestern snake populations have declined. Non-metric multidimensional scaling and Mantel tests demonstrate that differences in snake species composition in remnant and degraded prairies are discernable along gradients of urban and agricultural land cover. However, different patterns of abundance for individual snake species indicate that the relative importance of specific landscape factors differ among spe- cies, which has significant conservation implications. Here, I recommend that conserva- tionists use a species-specific approach to manage snake populations. I also stress the need for thorough inventory of snake populations and studies of snakehabitat relation- ships to advance our understanding of snake ecology and conservation within the little studied temperate grassland habitats of South America and eastern Eurasia.","Table 1 co-ordinates of sitesTable 3 abundances","","Hannah White","hannah.white11@imperial.ac.uk","Hannah White",1,22,154,7

However, there is a remarkable lack of information on the impact of forestry on native biodiversity. We analyzed the effect of Pinus ponderosa plantations on bird communities, considering different stand management practices (dense and sparse tree covers), and different landscape contexts where they are planted (Austrocedrus chilensis forest and steppe). Ultimately we wished to assess in which way plantations may be designed and managed to improve biodiversity conservation. Bird richness and abundance did not change significantly in the steppe, although community composition did, and was partially replaced by a new community, similar to that of ecotonal forests. In contrast, in the A. chilensis forest areas, species richness decreased in dense plantations, but bird community composition remained relatively constant when replacing the native forest with pine plantations. Also, in A. chilensis forest, stand man- agement practices aiming at maintaining low tree densities permit the presence of many bird species from the original habitat. In the steppe area in turn, both dense and sparse plantations are unsuitable for most steppe species, thus it is necessary to manage them at higher scales, maintaining the connectivity of the native matrix to prevent the fragmen- tation of bird populations. We conclude that pine plantations can provide habitat for a substantial number of native bird species, and this feature varies both with management practices and with the landscape context of areas where afforestation occurs.","Data provided separately by author","","Hannah White","hannah.white11@imperial.ac.uk","Sam Hill",1,53,2173,41

declines, and although recent work has illustrated the important influence of broad-scale ecological patterns and processes on amphibian populations, little is known about the factors structuring amphibian communities in urban landscapes. We therefore examined amphibian community responses to wetland habitat availability and landscape characteristics along an urbanrural gradient in central Iowa, USA, a region experiencing rapid suburban growth. We conducted call surveys at 61 wetlands to estimate anuran calling activity, and quantified wetland habitat structure and landscape context. We used canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to examine patterns in anuran community structure and identify the most important variables associated with those patterns. Urban density at the landscape scale had a significant negative influence on overall anuran abundance and diversity. While every species exhibited a decrease in abundance with increasing urban density, this pattern was especially pronounced for species requiring post-breeding upland habitats. Anurans most affected by urbanization were those associated with short hydroperiods, early breeding activity, and substantial upland habitat use. We suggest that broad-scale landscape fragmentation is an important factor underlying anuran community structure in this region, possibly due to limitations on the accessibility of otherwise suitable habitat in fragmented urban landscapes. This study underscores the importance of a regional approach to amphibian conservation in urban and urbanizing areas; in fragmented landscapes, a network of interconnected wetland and upland habitats may be more likely to support a successful, diverse anuran community than will isolated sites.","Abundance and location data provided separatly by author","","Hannah White","hannah.white11@imperial.ac.uk","Andy Purvis",1,61,549,9

In Sweden semi-natural pastures cover approximately 500,000 ha. However, power-line corridors,
road verges and clear-cuts cover larger areas (in total about 2,000,000 ha), and these open, less
intensively managed habitats are potentially important for species associated with taller vegetation
and flower resources (e.g. pollinating insects). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relative
importance of semi-natural pastures and the other three open habitats for butterflies in 12 forest-farmland
mosaic landscapes in south central Sweden. Species composition differed significantly between habitats
in multivariate analyses. Power-line corridors and semi-natural pastures harbored several species
that were disproportionally abundant in these habitats (13 and 8 species, respectively), and power-line
corridors also harbored several species that were classified as typical in indicator species analyses. There
were more butterfly species, higher abundances and a tendency for more individuals of red-listed species
in power-line corridors than in the other three habitats. Effects of the surrounding landscape composition
seemed to be weaker than that of the local habitat. However, species composition was significantly associated
with landscape composition and species with intermediate and low mobility were more abundant
in forested landscapes than in landscapes dominated by arable fields. Analyses of flying time and host
plants for larvae suggest that early flying species and species associated with dwarf shrubs were more
common in power-line corridors than in the other habitats. A landscape perspective, which takes several
habitats into account, is needed for conservation of butterfly communities in forest-farmland landscapes.
Power-line corridors and road verges offer possibilities for creating habitats that are suitable for pollinating
insects through conservation-oriented management.","Data provided separately by author","","Hannah White","hannah.white11@imperial.ac.uk","Sam Hill",1,95,5985,63

Understanding the process of understory succession is thus of critical importance for the devel- opment of management guidelines for biodiversity restoration in post-agricultural plantation forests. We studied effects of stand age, forest fragmentation, and soil and canopy conditions on species rich-
ness and abundance of four species groups in the understory of post-arable oak plantations in southern Sweden: herbaceous forest specialists, habitat generalists and open-land species, and woody species. The group of forest specialists may approach the richness of continuously forested sites after 60
80 years in non-fragmented plantations, but many forest species were sensitive to habitat fragmentation. Open-land species richness decreased during succession, while the richness of woody species and of gen- eralists remained stable, and was not affected by fragmentation. Abundance of generalists gradually decreased in non-fragmented plantations, probably due to competition from colonizing forest specialists. Soil pH in post-arable stands remained consistently higher than in continuously forested stands, which maintained differences in species composition. The development of a shrub layer seemed to imply a com- petitive advantage for forest specialists compared to generalist species. For successful recovery of a rich understory, we suggest that post-arable plantations should be estab-
lished on loamy soils of intermediate to high pH proximate to older forest with source populations, and that a continuous overstory canopy cover of 7080% is maintained by regular light thinnings and promo- tion of a shrub layer.","Data provided separately by author","","Hannah White","hannah.white11@imperial.ac.uk","Andy Purvis",1,48,9168,191

Bird declines in northern temperate latitudes are attributed to habitat loss and degradation in farmed landscapes. Conversely, landscape-modification effects on grassland/farmland bird communities are less studied in the South American temperate grasslands.Weinvestigated how bird communities were influenced by landscape characteristics in the Rolling Pampa (Argentina). We sampled bird communities in 356 landscapes of 1-km radius that varied in cover and configuration of pastureland, flooding grassland and cropland. Using generalized linear models, we explored the relationship between both bird species richness and abundance, and landscape structure. Analyses were carried out for all species, and open-habitat, grassland and aquatic species. Pasture area was far the most important factor, followed by landscape composition, in predicting species richness and abundance, irrespective of specific habitat preferences, followed by partially-flooded grassland cover and its mean shape index. Grassland frag- mentation did not affect species richness or abundance. When comparing the effects of landscape variables on bird richness and abundance (using mean model coefficients), pasture and grassland area effects were on average more than four times greater than those of compositional heterogeneity, and about ten times greater than shape effects. To conserve species-rich bird communities persisting in Rolling Pampa farmland, we recommend the preservation of pasture and grassland habitats, irrespective of their fragmentation level, in intensively managed farmland mosaics.","Data provided separately by author","","Hannah White","hannah.white11@imperial.ac.uk","Hannah White",1,360,36720,102

Here I report the results of a landscape-scale, before-and-after, treatmentcontrol experiment designed to test how communities of forest Lepidoptera experience (1) changes in species richness and composition and (2) shifts in species dominance one year after logging. I sampled Lepidoptera from 20 forest stands allocated to three harvest treatments (control, even-aged shelterwood or clearcuts, and uneven-aged group selection cuts) within three watersheds at Morgan-Monroe State Forest, Indiana, USA. Moths were sampled from all forest stands one year prior to harvest in 2007 and immediately post-harvest in 2009. Species composition was most significantly affected by temporal variation between years, although uneven-aged management also caused significant changes in lepidopteran community structure. Furthermore, species richness of Lepidoptera was higher in 2007 compared to 2009 across all watersheds and forest stands. The decrease in species richness between years, however, was much larger in even-aged and uneven-aged management units compared to the control. Furthermore, matrix stands within the even-aged management unit demonstrated the highest resistance to species loss within any management unit. Species dominance was highly resistant to effects of timber harvest, with pre- and post-harvest values for Simpson diversity nearly invariant. Counter to prediction, however, the suite of dominant taxa differed dramatically among the three management units post-harvest. My results suggest that temporal variation may have strong interactions with timber harvest, precipitating loss of nearly 50% species richness from managed stands regardless of harvest level. Even-aged management, however, appeared to leave the smallest footprint on moth communities. Timber harvest also created greater heterogeneity in species dominance among management units, suggesting that forest watersheds may diverge in post-harvest recovery transients relative to unlogged watersheds in Morgan-Monroe State Forest. Because moth communities appear to be highly sensitive to group-selection cuts, shelterwood cuts, and clearcuts, it will be important to retain unlogged concessions within management units to resist landscape-level loss of Lepidoptera.","Data provided separately by author","","Hannah White","hannah.white11@imperial.ac.uk","Hannah White",1,80,29040,363

classified as threatened due to the scarcity of this kind of habitat. Parks, which often
contain many old trees, are therefore considered to be important sites for this fauna.
However parks are intensively managed and dead wood is often removed. Therefore this
study compares if the saproxylic beetle fauna in parks is as diverse as it is in more natural
stands. Eight Park sites at manor houses around lake Ma¨laren, Sweden were compared
with trees in wooded meadows: eight grazed sites, here termed Open, and 11 sites
regrown with younger trees, termed Re-grown. The comparison was made on lime trees
(Tilia spp.): one of the most frequent tree species in old parks which host a diverse beetle

beetles belonging to 323 species, of which 50 were red-listed. When comparing all
saproxylic species, Park sites had significantly fewer species than Open sites. However,
for beetles in hollow trees and for red-listed species there was no significant difference, the

Grasslands are particularly important habitats for the conservation of rich insect assemblages of Central and Eastern Europe. Although regular grazing or mowing of these grasslands is required to maintain diversity, there is no information about how such management and other factors influence Hemiptera assemblages.

2. We studied leafhopper and true bug assemblages in semi-natural grasslands in three regions of the Great Hungarian Plain. We investigated how local vegetation factors and landscape complexity influence assemblages and whether they interact with management effects.

3. Seven pairs of intensively (>1 cow/ha) versus extensively (∼0.5 cow/ha) grazed pastures were sampled in each region by sweep-netting.

4. Sward height was the most important explanatory factor for leafhoppers (84 species, 27264 individuals), as it increased both species number and abundance, and influenced assemblage composition. The extent of grassland surrounding the sample sites negatively affected leafhoppers, whereas extensive grazing decreased abundance and influenced composition. True bug assemblages (140 species, 6656 individuals) were positively affected only by mean sward height, whereas regional differences determined the community composition of both taxa.

5. We conclude that vegetation structure is the primary factor shaping Hemiptera communities and that the various types of grasslands studied are all important habitats for the taxon. Therefore, cattle grazing in its current form is beneficial for the rich Hemiptera fauna in lowland pastures of Hungary. However, in some cases, local and landscape factors and great regional differences may confound the effects of grazing, and this must be considered in conservation planning in the future.","Abundance data provided separately by authorLocations within paperLocations within paper","","Hannah White","hannah.white11@imperial.ac.uk","Sam Hill",1,42,9660,230

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of conversion of native open vegetation to conifer plantations on mammalian carnivore assemblages in NW Patagonia, Argentina. We conducted camera-trap surveys at 69 sites and assessed composition of carnivore assemblages and habitat use in conifer plantations and native vegetation. We also evaluated habitat characteristics at stand and landscape scales related to presence of carnivores. Four species of carnivores were detected: Lycalopex culpaeus, Conepatus chinga, Puma concolor, and Leopardus geoffroyi. L. culpaeus and C. chinga used continuous native vegetation most frequently, but also used dense conifer plantations and tended to be more abundant in firebreaks and sparse plantations than in dense plantations. L. geoffroyi was almost fully restricted to continuous native vegetation, but was also detected in firebreaks and native vegetation remnants between plantations; this species was never detected in plantations. P. concolor was detected in all habitat types and did not exhibit any preference.

In this study, we compared bird abundance and species richness between irregular-shaped and relatively continuous forests in the breeding and migratory seasons. Since the forests were surrounded by tree plantations rather than open lands, the edge effect may have been weak at the study site. Our results suggested that the irregular forest shape negatively affected forest bird abundance and spe- cies richness in the breeding season, but not in the migratory season. The response of birds varied with bird traits: migrants avoided the irregular-shaped forest, but residents did not. Among the residents, small ones pre- ferred or tolerate the irregular-shaped forest whereas large ones avoided it. This study indicates that careful consid- eration of various factors such as seasonality and bird traits is needed to understand the consequences of land use changes on forest birds.","Abundance data provided separately by author.

Surveys were conducted in Sydney, Australia, during springsummer of 2008 in 29 defined 25 km2 landscapes, across various land uses. We quantified bathabitat relationships using local and landscape scale variables. We recorded 17 taxa across the urban gradient, with substantial variation in the tolerance and sensitivity of each spe- cies. The density of houses, landscape geology, the amount of bushland (ha) exclusively on fertile geolo- gies and moth biomass were the most frequent predictors of individual activity, explaining more than 60% of variation in activity for some species. Importantly, the area of bushland on poorer soils was not a good predictor, highlighting the need for caution when interpreting results of large scale studies which do not account for variations in habitat productivity. Species-specific differences existed, although the majority of the assemblage was considered to be urban-sensitive. Many of these sensitive species were most active in fertile suburban habitats, with an average of 1228% bushland cover within 5 km. Our study demonstrates the necessity to elucidate species-specific habitat relationships, and suggests bats would benefit from the conservation of productive suburban bushland remnants and riparian habitats, while improving connectivity to these areas via the maintenance of tree cover across the matrix.","Data provided separately by author","","Hannah White","hannah.white11@imperial.ac.uk","Hannah White",1,113,1921,17

for transit or foraging, with the exception of bearded pigs (Sus barbatus), sambar (Rucervus unicolor), and
civets which were more common in Acacia stands. The amount of secondary forest preserved within forest

Grazing by domestic livestock is one of the most widespread uses of the rangelands of Australia. There is
limited information on the effects of grazing by domestic livestock on the vertebrate fauna of Australia and the
establishment of a long-term grazing experiment in north-eastern Queensland at Wambiana provided an opportunity to
attempt an examination of the changes in vertebrate fauna as a consequence of themanipulation of stocking rates. The aim
was to identify what the relative effects of vegetation type, stocking rate and other landscape-scale environmental factors
were on the patterns recorded. Sixteen 1-ha siteswere establishedwithin three replicated treatments (moderate, heavy and
variable stocking rates). The sites were sampled in the wet and dry seasons in 19992000 (T0) and again in 200304 (T1).
All paddocks of the treatments were burnt in 1999. Average annual rainfall declined markedly between the two sampling
periods, which made interpretation of the data difficult. A total of 127 species of vertebrate fauna comprising five
amphibian, 83 bird, 27 reptile and 12 mammal species were recorded. There was strong separation in faunal composition
from T0 to T1 although changes in mean compositional dissimilarity between the grazing stocking rate treatments were
less well defined. Therewas a relative change in abundance of 24 bird, fourmammal and five reptile species from T0 to T1.
The generalised linear modelling identified that, in the T1 data, there was significant variation in the abundance of
16 species explained by the grazing and vegetation factors. This study demonstrated that vertebrate fauna assemblage did
change and that these changes were attributable to the interplay between the stocking rates, the vegetation types on the
sites surveyed, the burning of the experimental paddocks and the decrease in rainfall over the course of the two surveys.
It is recommended that the experiment is sampled again but that the focus should be on a rapid survey of abundant taxa
(i.e. birds and reptiles) to allow an increase in the frequency of sampling and replication of the data. This would help to
articulate more clearly the trajectory of vertebrate change due to the relative effects of stocking rates compared with
wider landscape environmental changes. Given the increasing focus on pastoral development in northern Australia,
any opportunity to incorporate the collection of data on biodiversity into grazing manipulation experiments should
be taken for the assessment of the effects of land management on faunal species.","","","Hanbin Zhang","nervak8@gmail.com","Hanbin Zhang",1,32,4064,127

Resumen
El objetivo principal de este estudio fue analizar la relación entre la densidad poblacional del venado cola blanca 
Odocoileus virginianus con algunas características del hábitat en el bosque tropical seco de la Reserva de la Biosfera de 
Tehuacán-Cuicatlán (TCBR), México. Para estimar la densidad y caracterizar el hábitat, se colocaron 32 transectos de franja 
(500 x 2 m) en cuatro diferentes localidades de la TCRB de mayo a junio de 2010. Se llevaron a cabo análisis de 
componentes principales para ordenar los 32 transectos conforme a las variables del hábitat, impacto humano y su 
composición vegetal. La densidad promedio fue de 1.7 venados/km2, con una variación entre de 0.1 a 2.9 venados/km2.
Las variables relacionadas con la densidad del venado fueron el área basal, la distancia a caminos, la distancia a la localidad 
con mayor número de habitantes, la orientación y la presencia de ganado. En las localidades con mayor densidad de 
venados las plantas dominantes fueron Zapotillo (Lantana camara) Chintoborrego (Vallesia glabra), Nanche (Bunchosia
biocellata, Cuachalalate (Amphipterigyum adstringens) y Cuajiote Amarillo (Bursera aptera). Comparado con otros bosques 
tropicales, las densidades estimadas en la TCBR fueron menores. Se discute el posible efecto de estas variables sobre la 
densidad del venado y se sugieren algunas acciones de manejo.

interactions between the loss of native vegetation and land-use intensification. Disentangling the influence
of these two processes on species persistence is an important step towards reconciling conservation
and agriculture production. We investigated how forest cover and management intensification affect the
conservation value of cacao agroforests for mammals in an Atlantic forest landscape in southern Bahia,
the most extensive area of diverse shaded cacao plantations in Brazil. Although both factors affected
the distribution of mammal species, management intensification had a stronger effect, negatively affecting
a larger number of species. Frequency of domestic dogs, an indirect aspect of management intensification,
negatively affected four species and lower connectivity of shading trees decreased the use of cacao
agroforests by three species of conservation concern. In comparison, the reduced forest cover negatively
affected two species of conservation concern. Our results suggest that controlling domestic dog populations
is particularly valuable for large mammal conservation in agroforestry mosaics, since it does not
affect crop productivity. Improving shade cover within agroforests, on the other hand, should be implemented
carefully, maintaining acceptable yield while promoting canopy connectivity and the recruitment
of tree species used by forest dependent mammals. However, the importance of both local
management intensification and local forest cover are likely to be context dependent, and changes in
their relative importance are likely to occur with different levels of deforestation at the landscape scale.","","","Hanbin Zhang","nervak8@gmail.com","Hanbin Zhang",1,40,840,21

A 14-ha limestone plantation forest served as a reference site. Ten to fifteen of the total 61 species (16.4-24.6%) expected in the nine forest fragments (taken as a whole) had been lost in the previous 50 years. These species are known to occur in the tropical rainforest on Cuernos de Negros and environs in south-eastern Negros Island at altitudes <500m above sea level. The factors responsible for the loss of these species appear to be (1) removal of large trees, which decreases canopy cover causing physical changes; and (2) forest fragmentation, which increases the edge areas. However, it is not possible to separate the effects of each of these two factors. The main factor that was correlated with the number of species in the limestone forest fragments appeared to be area. Two species of frogs appeared to be represented by relatively moderate population densities: the Negros cave frog (Platymantis spelaeus) and the common forest frog (Platymantis dorsalis).

Despite its importance, few empirical studies of effects of fragmentation on biodiversity have been undertaken in the region, limiting our ability to inform land-use regimes at a time of increased pressure on forests. We estimated the biodiversity value of forest fragments in peninsular Malaysia by studying fragmentation impacts on insectivorous bat species that vary in dependence of forest. We sampled bats at seven continuous forest sites and 27 forest fragments, and tested the influence of fragment isolation and area on the abundance, species richness, diversity, composition and nestedness of assemblages, and the abundance of the ten most common species. Overall, isolation was a poor predictor of these variables. Conversely, forest area was positively related with abundance and species richness of cavity/foliage-roosting bats, but not for that of cave-roosting or edge/open space foraging species. The smallest of fragments (< 150 ha) were more variable in species composition than larger fragments or continuous forest, and larger fragments retained substantial bat diversity, comparable to continuous forest. Some fragments exhibited higher bat abundance and species richness than continuous forest, though declines might occur in the future because of time lags in the manifestation of fragmentation effects. our findings suggest that fragments > 300 ha contribute substantially to landscape-level bat diversity, and that small fragments also have some value. However, large tracts are needed to support rare, forest specialist species and should be the conservation priority in landscape-level planning. Species that roost in tree cavities or foliage may be more vulnerable to habitat fragmentation than those that roost in caves. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we describe nested subset patterns of amphibian and reptile occupancy on 23 forest islands in north-eastern Bolivia. We used observed occupancy patterns to differentiate five distributional guilds: widespread species, rare species, poor colonizers, area-sensitive species and supertramps. Amphibian occurrences were nested along a forest island isolation gradient, and when species from each of the distribution classes were removed from subsequent analyses of nestedness, we found that dispersal-limited poor colonizers were responsible for the association between nestedness and isolation. Amphibians associated with the grassland matrix at the study site showed a nested pattern linked with area, although this pattern did not scale up to all amphibians and could not be unequivocally attributed to any of the distributional guilds we recognized. There were no strong associations between two biological characteristics, body size and relative abundance in the matrix, and the likelihood of occupancy along either forest island area or isolation gradients. The relative importance of isolation in shaping nested patterns of amphibians on these forest islands may be a result of either (1) the greater range in isolation values included in this study compared with many others; (2) the long time since isolation in this landscape, manifesting a footprint of isolation not apparent in more recently fragmented patches; (3) the relatively homogeneous grassland matrix surrounding forest islands that likely provides little refuge for animals moving among forest islands.","Appendix 1 for abundance data (filename:  ""Watling et al. 2009 appendix"")

Live-traps and pitfalls were used for trapping small mammals; larger mammals were recorded from footprints and sightings. Seventeen species of small mammal and 15 species of large mammal were recorded. Small mammals were affected by fragment size and isolation, whereas larger mammals were not. Communities of small mammals were better structured in the largest fragments, and those in smaller fragments were subsets of the communities in larger fragments. Gallery forests revealed a rather different assemblage of mammals, but also contained species common to both gallery and large savannah remnants. Data are discussed relating mammal community structure to area size and vegetation structure, in an attempt to understand the present conservation status of this fragmented landscape.","p493 Figure 1 map of sampling sitesp501 Table 3 abundance datap505 Table 5 abundance data","","Julie Day","julie.day08@imperial.ac.uk","Julie Day",2,10,170,34

Southeast Asia has the highest deforestation rate in the world, but the resulting losses of biological diversity remain poorly documented. Between November 2006 and March 2008, we conducted bird surveys on six landbridge islands in Malaysia and Indonesia. These islands were surveyed previously for birds in the early 1900s, when they were extensively forested. Our bird inventories of the islands were nearly complete, as indicated by sampling saturation curves and nonparametric true richness estimators. From zero (Pulau Malawali and Pulau Mantanani) to 15 (Pulau Bintan) diurnal resident landbird species were apparently extirpated since the early 1900s. Adding comparable but published extinction data from Singapore to our regression analyses, we found there were proportionally fewer forest bird extinctions in areas with greater remaining forest cover. Nevertheless, the statistical evidence to support this relationship was weak, owing to our unavoidably small sample size. Bird species that are restricted to the Indomalayan region, lay few eggs, are heavier, and occupy a narrower habitat breadth, were most vulnerable to extinction on Pulau Bintan. This was the only island where sufficient data existed to analyze the correlates of extinction. Forest preservation and restoration are needed on these islands to conserve the remaining forest avifauna. Our study of landbridge islands indicates that deforestation may increasingly threaten Southeast Asian biodiversity.","Species data found in Sodhi et al. 2010 appendix.

We also assessed whether the mechanisms influencing nestedness differed among these taxonomic groups. Location Thousand Island Lake, China. Methods Presence/absence matrices were compiled for birds (42 islands) and lizards (42 islands) using line-transect methods, and for small mammals (14 islands) using live-trapping methods from 2006 to 2009. Nestedness was analysed using BINMATNEST, and statistical significance was assessed using the conservative null model 3. We used Spearman rank correlations and partial Spearman rank correlations to examine associations of nestedness and habitat variables (area, isolation, habitat diversity and plant richness) as well as life-history traits (body size, habitat specificity, geographical range size and area requirement) related to species extinction and immigration tendencies. Results The community compositions of birds, lizards and small mammals were all significantly nested, but the causal factors underlying nestedness differed among taxonomic groups. For birds, island area, habitat specificity and area requirement were significantly correlated with nestedness after controlling for other independent variables. For lizards, habitat heterogeneity was the single best correlate of nestedness. For small mammals, island area, habitat heterogeneity and habitat specificity were significantly correlated with nestedness. The nested patterns of birds, lizards and small mammals were not attributable to passive sampling or selective colonization. Main conclusions The processes influencing nested patterns differed among taxonomic groups. Nestedness of bird assemblages was driven by selective extinction, and lizard assemblage was caused by habitat nestedness, while nestedness of small mammals resulted from both selective extinction and habitat nestedness. Therefore, we should take taxonomic differences into account when analysing nestedness to develop conservation guidelines and refrain from using single taxa as surrogates for others.","p864 Figure 1 map of sampling sites

To answer this question, the amphibian fauna of intact rain forests was compared with that of secondary forests, Eucalyptus plantations and rice fields. The main consequence of rain forest disturbance was loss of amphibian species. Compared with an intact forest, species richness in secondary forests, Eucalyptus plantations and rice fields were 54%, 46% and 12%, respectively. Species number and individual density increased with increasing structural complexity of the habitat and the presence of water bodies. The reproductive strategy of the species could be decisive for the presence or absence of single species in different habitats.

A few years after wildfire, regrowth was dense, most forest bird species were still present and additional understorey species appeared. As a result, species richness and abundance per point count increased. In contrast, when forest was transformed into savanna, the avian assemblage became poor, dominated by granivores and aerial insectivores,with only seven species shared with the original forest.

First, we examine how a variety of biotic, abiotic and anthropogenic factors influence the endemic and introduced arthropod richness on an oceanic island. Second, we look at the relationship between the endemic and introduced arthropod richness, to ask whether areas with high levels of endemic species richness deter invasions.

Location The work was carried out on a young volcanic island, Terceira, in the Azores.

Methods We used standard techniques to collect data on arthropod species richness. Environmental data were obtained from the CIELO climatic model and using GIS. The explanatory value of environmental variables on a small-scale gradient of endemic and exotic arthropod species richness was examined with  generalized linear models (GLMs). In addition, the impact of both endemic and exotic species richness in the communities was assessed by entering them after the environmental variable(s) to see if they contributed significantly to the final model (the hierarchical method).

Results Abiotic (climatic and geomorphological) variables gave a better explanation of the variation in endemic species richness, whereas anthropogenic  variables explained most of the variation in introduced species richness. Furthermore, after accounting for all environmental variables, part of the unexplained variance in the endemic species richness is explained by the introduced species richness and vice-versa. That is, areas with high levels of endemic species richness had many introduced species. There is evidence of a  somewhat inverse spatial distribution between a group of oceanic-type, forestdwelling, endemic, relict arthropods and a group of more generalist endemic arthropods that are able to survive in disturbed marginal sites particularly rich in non-indigenous species.

Main conclusions Richness of endemic species is mainly driven by abiotic factors such as a climatic axis (oceanic-type localities with lower temperatures  and summer precipitations) and a binary variable CALD (location of sites in caldeiras or ravines),  whereas richness of introduced species depends on disturbance related factors. However, after factoring out these major influences, there is a correlation between endemic and introduced richness, suggesting that  independent of the environmental and geographical factors that affect the distribution of endemic or introduced species  the richest endemic assemblages  are more prone to invasion, due probably to a facilitation process. Inconclusive evidence suggests that non-indigenous species are limited to those sites unde anthropogenic influence located mainly near forest edges, but the rate of expansion of those species to high-altitude, core pristine sites has still to be tested.","","","Katia Sanchez Ortiz","katia.ortiz.13@ucl.ac.uk","Katia Sanchez Ortiz",1,40,5600,140

However, what constitutes an old-growth stand is confusing because the definition depends largely on the forest type under study. Despite the ecological importance  of old-growth temperate rainforests in southern Chile in comparison to other global forests, no attempts have been made to characterize them as a way to assess their structural variability. Here, we
characterized old-growth stands of Valdivian and North Patagonian rain forest types located in Chiloe´ Island (Chile, 428300S) using inventory data from 23 permanent plots (0.1 ha each) located in rural landscapes and protected areas of northern Chiloe´ Island. For each stand, its age (average age of the oldest trees present in each stand) and disturbance regimes (evidence of recent human impact, e.g. cuttings or fires, and tree growth rates) were used as defining old-growth criteria.We characterized the structure (tree species richness, size-density distributions, vertical stratification and presence of snags) and floristic composition of each stand. Environmental variables (i.e. temperature, distance to coastline and elevation) were related to stand structure using multivariate constrained correspondence analysis. Old-growth forests were commonly characterized by (a) tree basal areas >80 m2/ha; (b) density of  shade-tolerant tree species in the emergent and dominant canopy layer >36%; (c) higher tree species  richness (>7 tree species) than successional stands; (d) presence of large canopy emergents (>80 cm dbh, >25 m tall); (e) high vertical heterogeneity; and (f) minimum stand ages older than 200 years. Old-growth forests showed a distinctive structural variability and floristic diversity influenced both by stand age and disturbance history of the stands. Structural variability was also related to environmental differences among sites (e.g. air temperature, distance to coastline, soil types). Oldgrowth forest features described here can offer a baseline for managers interested in maintaining and restoring old-growth forest structure in southern temperate rain forests.","","","Katia Sanchez Ortiz","katia.ortiz.13@ucl.ac.uk","Katia Sanchez Ortiz",1,27,783,29

We related bird species richness and community assemblage to landscape- and patch- level factors in 40 forest patches in the densely populated metropolitan area of San Juan, Puerto Rico. In total, 54 bird species were observed including 26 resident, 10 endemic, 12 migratory, and 6 introduced species. Patch size, level of urbanization in the surrounding matrix, and vertical heterogeneity of forest patches were the most important variables in explaining species richness. Patch size had the highest predictive power in explaining species  richness for all groups except migrants, which were best predicted by patch-level factors (vegetation heterogeneity). The degree of matrix urbanization was correlated negatively with endemic species richness, but positively with introduced species. Endemic species were particularly sensitive to landscape factors (patch size, matrix urbanization, and canopy texture). Introduced species richness was not dependent on any patch-level factors. Eight species were relatively unaffected by urbanization, whereas two species were only found in large forest patches, and two species were sensitive to urban development. Seven species demonstrated a preference for small patches. Recommendations for land managers and conservation agencies to maintain a high bird species richness and diversity include: (1) preserve both large and small forest patches, (2) limit urban development near forest patches, (3) manage forest patch structure to  maintain vertical heterogeneity, and (4) maintain forest patches with different vegetation types.","","Copy of Suarez-Rubio_birddatabase (Sheet: Spp_ecological traits)","Katia Sanchez Ortiz","katia.ortiz.13@ucl.ac.uk","Katia Sanchez Ortiz",1,40,2160,54

Species richness and abundance were higher in the logged forest than in the unlogged forest, but not significantly so. Species assemblages, on the other hand, were significantly different and were associated with different environmental variables in the logged and unlogged forest. The findings from this study corroborate other studies that have shown that species composition in logged forest does not appear to return to unlogged forest composition, even after three to six decades have passed. Since this study was not a before-and-after comparison, it is difficult to confirm whether the differences arise from the residual effects of logging or from the general patchiness of species
distribution in tropical forest.

The AM fungal small sub-unit (SSU) rRNA genes were subjected to PCR, cloning, sequencing and phylogenetic analyses. Twenty AM fungal sequence types were identified: 19 belong to the Glomeraceae and one to the Paraglomeraceae. Two AMF sequence types related to cultured AMF species (Glo G3 for Glomus sinuosum and Glo G6 for Glomus intraradices-G. fasciculatum-G. irregulare) did not occur in the soil cultivated with J. curcas and R. communis.

The diversity of the AMF community decreased in the soil of both crops, with respect to the native vegetation soil, and varied significantly depending on the crop species planted.

Lands without agricultural or urban use embedded within agricultural and urban regions now account for ~35% of Earths terrestrial extent. Although created by human disturbances, these novel ecosystems, usually poor in native flora and often dominated by alien species, do not require human intervention for their maintenance. Given their large and increasing area, however, their ability to support native  and especially threatened  faunas warrants investigation. With 20 species already extinct and 47 of its 91 extant species assessed as Endangered or Critically Endangered, Sri Lankas amphibian fauna is in trouble. The 18 anurans (12 of these Endangered) occurring above 1500m in the islands central mountains are at particular risk from drastic declines in the extent and quality of habitat. Habitat restoration, however, is retarded by successional vegetation being arrested at least in the decadal time-frame by alien invasive species, creating a novel ecosystem. Aim. To investigate whether such an ecosystem is able to support native anurans with a species richness and abundance comparable to that of neighbouring tropical montane cloud forest.
Methods.Wesurveyed 110 transects (each 20m2m) across three neighbouring locations covering three microhabitattypes,
and recorded 552 specimens. One-way analyses of variance and post hoc, pair-wise Tukeys tests were performed to test for differences in species richness and abundance among the three microhabitat types.
Key result. Of the 15 anuran species occurring in the neighbouring primary forest, 12 (eight of them Endangered) had established populations in the novel ecosystem (a former tea plantation), with abundances comparable to (or in some cases
exceeding) those in primary forest.
Conclusion. Even young secondary forest dominated by alien plant species, in which native vegetation is almost wholly absent, can provide adequate habitat for most threatened highland anurans in Sri Lanka.
Implications. (1) Even if florally poor and dominated by alien species, novel ecosystems may present potential  conservation opportunities for previously threatened faunas. (2) Threatened anurans exclusively dependent on primary forest and unable to utilise secondary-growth forest should receive greater conservation attention and be prioritised for in situ conservation measures. (3) Given their large and increasing extent globally, novel ecosystems should be considered as part of the area of occupancy of species able to complete their life cycles in them when assessed for conservation purposes, rather than being arbitrarily discarded as degraded.","","","Katia Sanchez Ortiz","katia.ortiz.13@ucl.ac.uk","Katia Sanchez Ortiz",1,110,1540,14

with the assumption that other ecosystem components will follow. Here we investigate that assumption by documenting biogeographical patterns in an important invertebrate taxon, the parasitoid wasp family Ichneumonidae, in a recently reforested Hawaiian landscape. Specifically, we test the influence of (1) planting configurations (corridors versus patches), (2) vegetation age, (3) distance from mature native forest, (4) surrounding tree cover, and (5) plant community composition on ichneumonid richness, abundance, and composition. We sampled over 7,000 wasps, 96.5% of which were not native to Hawaii. We found greater relative richness and abundance of ichneumonids, and substantially different communities, in restored areas compared to mature forest and abandoned pasturelands. Non-native ichneumonids drive these differences; restored areas and native forest did not differ in native ichneumonid abundance. Among restored areas, ichneumonid communities did not differ by planting age or configuration. As tree cover increased within 120 m of a sampling point, ichneumonid community composition increasingly resembled that found in native forest. Similarly, native ichneumonid abundance increased with proximity to native forest. Our results suggest that restoration plantings, if situated near target forest ecosystems and in areas with higher local tree cover, can facilitate restoration of native fauna even in a highly invaded system.","","","Katia Sanchez Ortiz","katia.ortiz.13@ucl.ac.uk","Katia Sanchez Ortiz",1,754,15834,21

We compare these estimates between hunted and nonhunted sites within Manu Park, and with other Neotropical forest sites. Manu Park safeguards some of the most species-rich and highest biomass assemblages of arboreal and terrestrial mammals ever recorded in Neotropical forests, most likely because of its direct Andean influence and high levels of soil fertility. Relative to Barro Colorado Island, seed predators and arboreal folivores in Manu are rare, and generalist frugivores specializing on mature fruit pulp are abundant. The impact of such a qualitative shift in the vertebrate community on the dynamics of plant regeneration, and therefore, on our understanding of tropical plant ecology, must be profound. Despite a number of external threats, Manu Park continues to serve as a baseline against which other Neotropical forests can be gauged.","Map of sites on page 2.

northern Spain, in relation to different habitat types belonging to natural or disturbed ecosystems.
The primary objective was to find the relationship between anthropogenic use of land and several
diversity indices. Parameters such as abundance, species richness, real diversity (H9) and equitability
(J9) of the mite communities were calculated in 20 soil plots, sampled in spring and autumn 2000,
belonging to the predominant habitat types of this area: (1) cultivated lands, (2) abandoned crop
lands, (3) grasslands/pastures, and (4) natural oak forests or a pine plantation. The most widespread
species in the area as well as the most abundant taxa overall are documented, together with the
faunistic checklist of oribatid mites identified in the study. The results show a general decline in the
composition of the oribatid community, in terms of species diversity and abundance, from nondisturbed
soils to cultivated lands. The number of species (richness) was usually higher in forest soils
than in disturbed ecosystems, in which the most degraded soils showed the lowest number of species.
The community analysis shows the differences due to habitat type and ubiquitous bioindicator
species.","Table 1 p 3455, Table 2 p 3457, Appendix 1 p 3465.","","Morgan Garon","morgan.garon12@imperial.ac.uk","Morgan Garon",1,20,2320,116

greatest in the most intensively managed, agricultural sites. Detrended correspondence
analysis revealed a clear separation in beetle community structure between forested and

revealed a significant correlation between beetle community structure and the
environment, showing distinct beetle assemblages to be significantly associated with
specific edaphic and botanical features of the land-use gradient. This study adds to
increasing evidence that landscape-scale patterns in land-use significantly affect beetle

reduction of semi-natural grasslands in Eastern Europe. Subalpine semi-natural grasslands
in Transylvania, Romania, harbour a high diversity of plants and invertebrates,
including endemics, and are considered refugia for numerous threatened open-land species.
We investigated effects of land abandonment by examining species richness, species
abundance, proportion of open-land, endemic and threatened vascular plants, gastropods,
and diurnal and nocturnal Lepidoptera in extensive hay meadows (initial stage),
and three seral stages of succession (early stage of abandoned hay meadow, naturally
growing birch forest, and mature forest) in the mountainous region of Baisoara in Transylvania.
A total of 626 species (225 vascular plants, 16 gastropods, 68 diurnal and 317
nocturnal Lepidoptera) were found in the 16 study sites (four replicates per successional
stage). The four taxonomic groups differed in their response to the abandonment of hay
meadows. Each stage of succession harboured the maximum species richness for one
taxonomic group: extensive hay meadows for vascular plants, abandoned hay meadows
for diurnal Lepidoptera, birch forests for nocturnal Lepidoptera, and mature forests for
gastropods. In all four taxonomic groups the complementarity of species composition
increased with successional age, whereas the number of characteristic open-land species
decreased with successional age. The four successional stages did not differ in proportion
of red-listed plant and diurnal Lepidoptera species. In nocturnal Lepidoptera, however,
the proportion of red-listed species increased with successional age. Furthermore, successional
stages did not differ in number of plant species endemic to the Carpathians and
Eastern Europe. Our results indicate the high conservation value of all stages of subalpine
grassland succession for the indigenous biodiversity of Transylvania. To prevent losses of
characteristic species, we suggest a rotational grassland management program that
maintains different successional stages.","Table 1 p 263","","Morgan Garon","morgan.garon12@imperial.ac.uk","Morgan Garon",4,64,9776,611

Saturation of abundance and richness indicates strong limiting forces acting upon the oribatid community at intermediate and late
stages of succession. The continuous increase in the dominance of surface-dwelling and non-specialized species suggests a
considerable change in the nature of these limiting forces during the successional process. General Regression Model (GRM)
analysis revealed an increasing impact of external factors on the oribatid community during grassland succession, and a shift in the
major driving forces determining oribatid abundance from soil conditions to vegetation conditions and then to a combined effect of

had been gradually converted over a period of 50 yr. Abundance and biomass responded rapidly and very
positively to the conversion of arable land to grassland, while species richness was not affected. Collembolan
assemblages changed only little during grassland maturation. The impact of land-use change on community
structure was more obvious at the functional level because the colonization processes observed in our study
mostly relied on hemiedaphic species. Vegetation and soil parameters were good predictors of collembolan
community structure during development of managed grassland. The present study demonstrated that past
landscape patterns and processes like land-use conversion and subsequent succession had a considerable impact
on the present day pattern of species richness and community composition of Collembola within a landscape.
Our results strongly differ from those obtained for other invertebrate groups, highlighting on the one hand the
very diverse reactions of invertebrates to a common factor, and on the other hand the need to survey more than

Declining populations of UK grassland flora and fauna have been attributed to
intensification of agricultural management practices, including changes in cutting, fertilizer,
grazing and drainage regimes. We aimed to develop field margin management
practices that could reverse declines in intensively managed grassland biodiversity that
would have application in the UK and Europe. Here we focus on one aspect of grassland
biodiversity, the beetles.
2.
In four intensively managed livestock farms in south-west England, 10-m wide field
margins in existing grasslands were managed to create seven treatments of increasing
sward architectural complexity. This was achieved through combinations of inorganic
(NPK) fertilizer, cattle grazing, and timing and height of cutting. To examine the potential
influence of complexity on faunal diversity, beetles were identified to species level
from suction samples taken between 2003 and 2005, and their assemblage structure was
related to margin management, floral assemblages and sward architecture.
3.
Beetle abundance, and species richness and evenness were influenced by margin
management treatment and its interaction with year. Correlations with sward architecture
and the percentage cover of dominant forbs and grasses were also found. Functional
groups of the beetles showed different responses to the management treatments. In
particular, higher proportional abundances of seed/flower-feeding guilds were found
in treatments not receiving NPK fertilizer.
4.
The assemblage structure was shown to respond to margin management treatments,
sward architecture and the percentage cover of dominant forbs and grasses. The most
extensively managed treatments were characterized by distinct successional trajectories
from the control treatment.
5.
Synthesis and applications.
This study provides management options suitable for use
within agri-environment schemes intended to improve faunal diversity associated with
intensively managed lowland grasslands. Field margins receiving either no management
or a single July silage cut were shown to support greater abundances and species richness
of beetles, although subtler modifications of conventional management may also
be beneficial, for example the absence of NPK fertilizer while maintaining grazing and
silage cutting systems.","","","Morgan Garon","morgan.garon12@imperial.ac.uk","Morgan Garon",1,28,11396,407

structure. Plants were inventoried in crop fields and woody hedgerows (boundary and centre) of 16 conventional and 14 organic sites. Habitat
structure, agricultural practices and landscape characteristics were quantified for each habitat. Hedgerow boundaries contained a higher
number of plant species than adjacent habitats although many of them were exotics. However, exotics comprised a decreasing proportion of
species richness from field to hedgerow centre. Many of the exotic species were shared between crop fields and adjacent boundaries. There
was a clear difference in species richness and composition between the organic and conventional study sites. Fields and woody hedgerows
situated in organic sites consistently harboured more native and exotic plant species than those in conventional systems. Numerous species
were only found in organic hedgerows and included several long-lived herbaceous forest species. At the larger scale level, old-fields (areas

the composition and conservation value of habitats where afforestation is planned and the
effects of subsequent planting upon biodiversity. The objectives of this study were to
investigate changes in vegetation composition and diversity of grasslands 5 years after
afforestation with Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) and determine the primary ecological and
management factors responsible for these changes. Species cover, environmental and
management data were collected from 16 afforested and unplanted improved and wet
grassland site pairs in Ireland. Our results indicate that 5 years after tree planting, there
were significant changes in richness, composition, and abundance of species. Competitive
and vigorous grasses were more abundant in planted than in unplanted sites, as were
generalist species found in both open and wooded habitats, while small-stature shadesensitive
species were less abundant. Vascular plant species richness and Shannons
diversity index were higher in unplanted wet grassland, than in the planted sites. Bryophyte
species richness was higher in planted improved grassland than in unplanted sites. The
differences were primarily the result of the exclusion of grazing, ground preparation,
changes in nutrient management and drainage for afforestation. Drainage ditches provided
a temporary habitat for less competitive species, but the overall effect of drainage was to
reduce the diversity of species dependent on wet conditions. Variance partitioning showed
differences in the relative influences of environmental and management variables on
biodiversity in the two habitats, probably due to the greater pre-afforestation grazing
pressure and fertilisation levels in improved grasslands. The differences in biodiversity between planted and unplanted grasslands indicate that afforestation represents a threat to
semi-natural habitats where distinctive and highly localised plant communities could
potentially occur.","","","Morgan Garon","morgan.garon12@imperial.ac.uk","Morgan Garon",1,24,3360,140

Chile.We examined species diversity and composition of three different functional groups: understory vascular plants, epigeal beetles, and birds, in
paired stands of relatively undisturbed Nothofagus dombeyi forest and coniferous plantations. We also characterized the structure of each stand.
Exotic plantations generated significant impacts on biodiversity, diminishing species richness, abundance and diversity, and generating
modifications in assemblage composition. Replacement of N. dombeyi forests by conifer plantations led to a homogenization of habitat structure
at the stand scale. The largest impact was detected on understory plants, followed by the beetle and bird assemblages, supporting the view that the
least vagile assemblages are most affected by habitat replacement. The most relevant modifications caused by the plantations on the structure and
composition of the studied assemblages were a reduction in evenness in plants and beetles, an increase of exotic species richness from 16 to 29% in
plants and from none to one species in birds, and a loss of rare and specialist species in all three assemblages. Our findings suggest that plantations
with more open canopy could favor biodiversity by increasing individual abundance and species richness of all three assemblages.","Table 2 p1578","","Morgan Garon","morgan.garon12@imperial.ac.uk","Morgan Garon",3,24,1072,134

grasses were also more abundant in plots grazed at the
Low stocking rate, while an opposite trend was
observed for competitive grasses. Butterflies consistently
responded to alterations in vegetation composition,
especially to the dynamics of nectar plants. The

and livestock pest control. These are all factors which influence the environment of soil invertebrates.
In this study, soil macrofauna, mesofauna and microfauna were collected from duplicate 11 and 20 year
old organic and conventional legume-based sheep-grazed pasture systems. Pastures in both systems had
received the same annual input of reactive phosphate rock and elemental sulphur and were stocked with
the same numbers of sheep. The major difference between the two systems was absence of the chemical
control of livestock pests on the organic system, resulting in lower sheep liveweights. Two ungrazed
pastures which had not received any nutrient inputs for 20+ years were also sampled as part of the study
to provide an additional contrast.
No significant differences in either the diversity or abundance of the soil invertebrate community were
found between the organic and conventional systems, despite the use of chemicals in the conventional
system. The lack of difference suggests that many of the observed and reported responses to organic
managementreflect altered nutrient inputs and grazingmanagement(which were thesamein the current
study), rather than the cessation of chemical controls in the organic system. In contrast, the invertebrate
community in the unfertilised, ungrazed pasture was distinctly different from both the grazed systems.
The ungrazed pasture had a higher diversity with more New Zealand endemic species than the grazed
pasture. This included twice as many large Oribatida as soil pore size increased. The lower litter quality
from the lack of nutrient inputs in the ungrazed pasturewasreflected in both lower earthworm abundance
and the Nematode Channel Ratio (indicative of a higher proportion of fungal- than bacterial-feeding
nematodes), than the grazed pasture.
We conclude that organic management when limited to a comparison of livestock pest control is not
beneficial to soil invertebrates. Management practices such as stocking rates and fertiliser regime, by
altering the soil physical environment and food resources, are more important in influencing invertebrate
populations in this soil. Some would argue these altered management practices are an integral part of an
organic production system.","Table 1 p162, Table 3 p166.","","Morgan Garon","morgan.garon12@imperial.ac.uk","Morgan Garon",2,12,150,25

intensification or abandonment. As these grasslands host valuable biodiversity, conservation measures are needed for their
sustainable maintenance. We studied the effect of pastureland abandonment on plant communities at the Ponor Mt., a part
of the Balkan Mts., Bulgaria. Data on floristic composition, vegetation structure and several abiotic parameters were
collected in 137 randomly located 16-m2 plots in 2008. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to analyse how
species composition is related to abiotic and land use factors. Analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) were used to test for the
effects of sheep grazing vs. abandonment on vegetation structure and composition. The main environmental factors
explaining the compositional variation were related to the altitude, sheep grazing and soil depth. Pastureland abandonment
led to an increase in vegetation height and of the richness of mesophytes and leafy plants, and red-list species. Grazed plots
had higher total species richness, more xerophytes, rosette forming and spring-flowering species. To ensure the persistence
of the species of both the open grasslands and mid-successional grassland communities, the management should be carried

For phytophagous insects the impact is primarily a result of altering the structure and

even within an order there may be winners and losers from different grazing regimes.
2. A long-term, replicated, controlled experiment, comprising four grazing treatments,
was established within an upland acid grassland area in Scotland. Auchenorrhyncha
were sampled by suction sampling and sweep-netting in the fifth year
following the start of the treatments.
3. A significant treatment effect was apparent in the suction samples with Auchenorrhyncha
abundance being three to four times higher in the ungrazed plots compared
to the other treatments. Abundance was also highest from the ungrazed plots
in the sweep net samples, but this effect was not statistically significant. Redundancy
analysis (RDA) showed that a suite of species which are typical of shaded positions
responded with increased abundance in the ungrazed plots.
4. The findings demonstrate that the assemblages found in ungrazed areas can be
vastly different to those found in even lightly grazed areas and therefore, underline
the benefits of varied grazing regimes in maximising diversity. Furthermore, the
work underlines the benefit of employing multiple sampling methods.","Table 2 p 72","","Morgan Garon","morgan.garon12@imperial.ac.uk","Morgan Garon",2,187,4925,54

examine the effect of cattle grazing and site productivity on the abundance, species richness, and species diversity of ants in Lac
du Bois Grasslands Provincial Park, British Columbia, Canada. We hypothesized that the measured ant variables would be
lowest in grazed areas and at low site productivity. Pitfall trapping was conducted at four sites: two at each low and high site
productivity levels. At each site an ungrazed (fenced exclosure) and grazed transect was sampled during May, July, and August
of 2008. Captured ants were preserved in ethanol and identified. Eight genuses of ants were collected: Tapinoma, Camponotus,
Formica, Lasius, Aphaenogaster, Myrmica, Solinopsis, and Temnotharox. The mean number of ants per pitfall was higher at
high site productivity sites that were grazed (15.1062.96 SE) compared to high productivity sites ungrazed (3.2860.47 SE);
grazing at low productivity reduced numbers of ants from 5.07 (60.70 SE) to 2.20 (60.39 SE) (F521.806; P,0.001).
Tapinoma sessile and A. occidentalis had the greatest numbers in the pitfall traps. Species richness (F523.330, P,0.001) and
diversity (F511.764, P50.001) followed a similar trend. Because productivity and cattle grazing affect ant diversity and

To examine how native forest birds use such plantations, we surveyed in 2005 the avifauna at Sabah Softwoods, a plantation in southeastern Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. We focused on A. mangium, Albizia (Paraserianthes falcataria), oil palm (Elaeis guineensis), and logged native forest, and compared our results to those of a study conducted at the same plantation in 1982. The number of forest species in the industrial groves did not change dramatically between 1982 and 2005, even though the trees had been cropped several times and the plantation was, by 2005, completely surrounded by cleared land and far removed from primary forest. However, as is common in logged or isolated forests throughout the world, certain primary forest groups (e.g., muscicapine flycatchers) have been extirpated from the entire plantation area. The industrial groves also lacked some larger species of kingfisher, woodpeckers, and canopy frugivores. Nevertheless, numerous primary forest taxa (ca. 50% of species) were found in mature industrial tree groves. Albizia attracted the most species of birds, followed closely by Acacia. Both tree types underpinned relatively complex secondary forests that attracted forest birds. In contrast, younger groves of Acacia and Albizia held mainly open country and scrub species. Oil palm, as a remarkably simple and unusual habitat, attracted few bird species. Sustained occurrence of forest birds in all groves of exotic
trees at Sabah Softwoods was substantially enhanced by the relatively rich avifauna of the logged native
forest remaining in substantial stands throughout the plantation.","Acquired from author

To test these alternatives, we compared crop yields and densities of bird and tree species across gradients of agricultural intensity in southwest Ghana and northern India. More species were negatively affected by agriculture than benefited from it, particularly among species with small global ranges. For both taxa in both countries, land sparing is a more promising strategy for minimizing negative impacts of food production, at both current and anticipated future levels of production.","Acquired from author","","Michelle Harrison","michharri@hotmail.com","Michelle Harrison",2,32,5392,337

Farmers in the area believe small mammals provide a
service as an alternative food source, other than
sheep, for predators. We assessed the validity of this
reported ecosystem service. A total of 10 species and
219 individuals were recorded during this survey of
3600 trap-nights, with a total trap success rate of
6.1%. Significantly more individuals were caught
during the winter than in summer. Vegetation trans-
formation had a negative impact on small mammal
diversity. Density, diversity and distribution were
correlated with vegetation and landscape structural
diversity. Management decisions that reduce vegetation
structure and cover will have a negative impact on
small mammal density and diversity. Ensuring the
conservation of small mammals may have the benefit
of providing an alternative food source to predators, a
valuable ecosystem service to farmers.","page 119, Table 1","","Martin Jung","xzt217@alumni.ku.dk","Martin Jung",1,20,200,10

augmented or augmented only; thus these treatments appear not to have a significant negative effect on plant diversity at least in the short-term.
Deep ploughing, however, was detrimental to plant diversity. Results could be explained by the intermediate disturbance hypothesis i.e.
intermediate levels of disturbance prevent the competitive exclusion of subdominant species. The conclusion drawn from this study is that low-

characteristics and the type and scale of habitat modification involved. In contrast, direct or indirect ramifications on
mutualistic relationships between plants and animals are less clear, possibly because general patterns are confounded by
the diffuse nature of many of these interactions. Here, we examine how fragment size and/or severe disturbance of a
Kenyan mountain cloud forest affects the frugivore community and seed removal of a large-seeded, bird-dispersed tree of
the forest interior, for three consecutive years. Forest deterioration reduced avian visitation and seed removal rates
independent of fragment size, consistently so despite strong temporal variation in fruit production over the three-year
study. In disturbed forest fragments, seed removal rates were on average 3.5 times lower than in more intact ones. Strong
differences in both visitation and seed removal rates were largely attributable to shifts in frugivore assemblages,
characterized by loss or reduced abundance of the most effective seed dispersers, most of which were forest specialists.
Although some disturbed fragments benefited from visits of non-forest dependent seed dispersers, such resilience was
not predictable or reliable in time or space. We conclude that disruption of seed disperser-seed interactions in highly
fragmented and disturbed tropical forests may be persistent in time when resiliency is inadequate, possibly posing long-
term effects on tree communities.","Table 1, Figure 2, Appendix","Bird species functional traits.xls","Martin Jung","xzt217@alumni.ku.dk","Martin Jung",5,204,6286,144

activities, such as small-scale agriculture and trade, can affect their distribution
patterns. Four locations were sampled along a 250 km stretch of the Congo River. At
each location, pristine and disturbed habitats (i.e. tropical forests and small rural
villages, respectively) were sampled, with three replicate sites in each combination
of habitat and location. Sampling with modified McPhail traps baited with four
different attractants yielded 819 tephritid specimens of 29 species from seven genera
(Bactrocera, Carpophthoromyia, Ceratitis, Dacus, Celidodacus, Perilampsis, Trirhithrum).
The three most abundant species sampled (Dacus bivittatus, D. punctatifrons, Bactrocera
invadens) showed significant variations in abundance across locations and sites and
accounted for 98.29% of the overall dissimilarity between habitats. Assemblages
differed among locations and sites while they showed significant differences between
pristine and disturbed habitats in two out of the four locations. This study shows
that frugivorous tephritids in central Congo have remarkably patchy distributions
with differences among locations and sites representing the main source of variability.
Our data show that, in rural villages of central Democratic Republic of Congo,
human activities, such as small-scale agriculture and local commerce, are not always
sufficient to promote differences between the tephritid assemblages of villages
and those of the surrounding tropical forests.","Figure 1, Table 1","","Martin Jung","xzt217@alumni.ku.dk","Martin Jung",1,72,2160,30

Hills. We tested the hypotheses that there is a clear amphibian species turnover with elevation, and that human habitat disturbance influence abundance
of amphibian reproductive strategies. Transects were used in surveying amphibians. Sampling was done in two broad habitat types (terrestrial forests/
plantations, and aquatic streams/dams). We used Kruskal-Wallis to test the differences in amphibian species richness and diversity among the habitat
types, while EstimateS program was used to estimate species diversity and abundance. Comparison of species richness was done using Sørensen
similarity index with amphibian communities as zoogeographic indicators. Multivariate cluster analysis was used to examine the community similarity in
terms of habitat type and elevation. Cluster analysis of community similarity revealed distinct species assemblages in terms of elevation and habitat type.
Amphibian species richness increased with increased habitat disturbance from forests to streams and dams but decreased with increasing elevation.
However, abundance of species with direct developing mode of reproduction decreased with increased habitat modification/disturbance. These findings
clearly demonstrate that conservation investment in protection of the Taita Hills should be directed towards terrestrial indigenous forests which are home
to the three area endemics and direct developers (Boulengerula taitana, Boulengerula niedeni and Callulina dawida). We therefore strongly support efforts
to protect a network of these indigenous forest fragments with some form of connectivity alongside the human modified habitats. Recognizing the role of
ecosystem restoration in protecting biodiversity in fragmented habitats, this study strongly supports restoration efforts involving gradually replacing exotic
forest plantations with indigenous plants.","Figure 1, Table 2","traits.xls","Martin Jung","xzt217@alumni.ku.dk","Martin Jung",1,13,104,8

post logging effects on amphibian assemblages. Specifically, we assessed whether the diversity, abundance,
and assemblage composition of amphibians changed over time for forest-dependent species and those tolerant
of forest disturbance. In 2009, we sampled amphibians in 3 forests (total of 48 study plots, each 2 ha)
in southwestern Ghana. In each forest, we established plots in undisturbed forest, recently logged forest,
and forest logged 10 and 20 years previously. Logging intensity was constant across sites with 3 trees/ha
removed. Recently logged forests supported substantially more species than unlogged forests. This was due
to an influx of disturbance-tolerant species after logging. Simultaneously Simpson’s index decreased, with
increased in dominance of a few species. As time since logging increased richness of disturbance-tolerant
species decreased until 10 years after logging when their composition was indistinguishable from unlogged
forests. Simpson’s index increased with time since logging and was indistinguishable from unlogged forest 20
years after logging. Forest specialists decreased after logging and recovered slowly. However, after 20 years
amphibian assemblages had returned to a state indistinguishable from that of undisturbed forest in both
abundance and composition. These results demonstrate that even with low-intensity logging (≤3 trees/ha)
a minimum 20-year rotation of logging is required for effective conservation of amphibian assemblages in
moist semideciduous forests. Furthermore, remnant patches of intact forests retained in the landscape and
the presence of permanent brooks may aid in the effective recovery of amphibian assemblages.","Ghana, page 357.  Figure 1","","Martin Jung","xzt217@alumni.ku.dk","Martin Jung",1,48,1152,24

maintaining biodiversity within grassland ecosystems. Grassland birds have evolved within
this shifting mosaic to become reliant on specific habitat characteristics maintained under
varying levels of both natural and anthropogenic disturbance. Unfortunately, grasslands in
South Africa have been extensively transformed and remain poorly conserved, threatening
grassland avifauna. Mistbelt grassland is a threatened vegetation type endemic to the province
of KwaZulu-Natal, of which only 0.3% is formally protected. This study investigated seasonal
and patch type heterogeneity in a Mistbelt grassland avian community by determining avian
community structure and composition in four patch types, i.e. i) untransformed open grass-
land, ii) burnt grassland, iii) bramble-invaded and, iv) bramble-cleared grassland, during
winter and summer. Avian assemblages were significantly different between the different
patch types for each season. The bramble patch type negatively affected grassland bird species
diversity. Bramble-cleared grassland and untransformed grassland had similar vegetation
structure and avian communities in the summer, suggesting that the grassland bird community
benefitted soon after the clearing of invasive vegetation. This study provides further evidence
that bird diversity is enhanced in structurally heterogeneous grassland landscapes. Further-
more, the protection and appropriate management of privately owned Mistbelt grassland,
conserved in the form of rangeland, is an important refuge for threatened and endemic
avifauna, such as the globally-threatened blue swallow (Hirundo atrocaerulea) and wattled
crane (Bugeranus carunculatus).","Page 230 top","PREDICTS data version 2.0_Chevonne Reynolds.xlsx","Martin Jung","xzt217@alumni.ku.dk","Martin Jung",1,56,4536,81

periodic logging in forest ecosystems significantly changes biodiversity and whether the
changes can be mitigated through appropriate harvest methods. Such questions of timber
resource management, however, are rarely applied to nonpest insect species, particularly
in temperate forest systems. We studied the effects of timber harvest on species richness,
abundance, and community composition of forest Lepidoptera (moths). Moths were sampled
in 16 forest stands occurring in two watersheds (managed and wilderness) in southeastern
Ohio during summer 2000. Stands were chosen from one of four management categories:
clear-cut, selectively logged, unlogged, and wilderness. Specifically, we tested the following
predictions: (1) shifts in moth community composition would be affected by postharvest
changes in stand structure and floristic composition, (2) variation in species richness would
be determined by the magnitude of the logging disturbance, and (3) unlogged stands within
managed landscapes would contain different species assemblages compared to wilderness
stands.
Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed significant compositional differences
among moth communities sampled from forest stands differing in harvest regime.
Variation among moth communities was mainly attributable to postharvest changes in stand
floristic composition rather than stand structure. Postdisturbance shifts in moth community
composition were related to the magnitude of displacement of a given forest stand to earlier
successional stages. We also found that both species richness of the overall moth community
and several feeding guilds. were significantly lower in clear-cut stands, but species richness
did not differ between selectively logged and unlogged stands. Thus, selective logging
appears to be a better strategy for timber harvest when concern is for maintaining species
richness of Lepidoptera within stands. Finally, although no differences were detected in
overall species richness or abundance of moths sampled from stands in managed or wilderness
watersheds, the CCA suggested that the surrounding landscape influenced the variation
in community composition within and among forest stands. Therefore, we suggest
that the long-term maintenance of lepidopteran species diversity and community composition
within temperate deciduous forests managed for timber may ultimately depend on
successful regeneration of harvested stands to precut floristic composition as well as the
preservation of larger areas of unlogged forests.","","","Sara Contu","sara.contu@nhm.ac.uk","Sara Contu",1,64,32768,512

Two different silvicultural treatments were applied at each site: clearcutting across the stream channel and buffer strips 10 m wide on each side of the stream. Additionally, we studied 10 reference sites in unlogged riparian forests along similar-sized streams. All sites were studied before logging and then 2.5 years after logging. After clearcutting the number of individuals in a 0.5-m2 sample from each site decreased on average from 107 to 87, and the mean number of species per sample decreased from 9.9 to 7.7. Most species were negatively affected, but there were also clear differences in sensitivity. There were correlations between species survival and ground moisture. At the wettest clearcut sites with an almost intact bryophyte cover, the land snails were unaffected by clearcutting. This result suggests that wet or moist forest floors can serve as refugia even at very small spatial scales (e.g., shallow hollows, crevices). If this is an important mechanism, the spatial distribution of small habitats could be important for the long-term survival of the snail fauna or other small, dispersal-limited organisms at clearcut sites. In the buffer strips, the number of individuals decreased but not the number of species, indicating that buffer-strip retention is a good practice for protecting land snails in riparian forests. The varying effectiveness of the buffer strip could partly be explained by the proportion of the remaining basal area, emphasizing that buffer strips could be even more effective if efforts are made to avoid heavy damage by windthrows.","","","Sara Contu","sara.contu@nhm.ac.uk","Sara Contu",1,40,800,20

and of calcium content and disturbance in the base-poor

This expedition took great steps in elucidating the taxonomic status of many species. Since, work has focussed mainly on Grand Comore, with the majority of data collected in two expeditions by the Belgium Royal Museum for Central Africa in 1985 (Louette et al 1988) and 1989. These expeditions did much to identify patterns of distributions and abundances of key endemic species, distinguishing critical areas for conservation (Bijnens et al, 1987; Louette, 1988, 2000; Louette et al, 1988, 1989, 1992, 2004; Stevens et al, 1993, 1995).
Anjouan has been even more neglected than Grand Comore. Most work has focussed on the critically endangered Anjouan Scops Owl, Otus capnodes, since its rediscovery in 1992 (Safford, 1993; Moorcroft, 1995). However, patterns of species richness and distributions of endemic species remained unknown.
The work of this report sought to fill in some of the gaps in our knowledge of birds of the Comores; identifying the patterns of current species richness on Grand Comore and Anjouan and to compare these with that found by previous expeditions; to compare the patterns found with that of butterflies; and to identify a suitable indicator for bird species richness with which to carry out rapid biodiversity assessments. With these, appropriate strategies for conserving the biodiversity of the Comores can be suggested.
The avifauna is thought to be relatively complete, however it is possible a number of stenotopic endemic species of lower altitudes are now extinct since the complete deforestation of lower altitudes (Stevens et al 1993).
Grand Comore is the centre of endemism of the four islands. Five island endemics exist, of which four are confined to the slopes of Karthala: Otus pauliani, Humblotia flavirostris, Zosterops mouroniensis and Dicrurus fuscipennis. Nesillas brevicaudata can also be found on La Grille, a 1087m crater to the North of Karthala. There are a further four species endemic to the Comoros archipelago and 16 endemic subspecies (Butorides striatus, a coastal species, and Cyanolanius madagascarinus which has not been observed since 1982 are not included). Fodies, which were identified only to genus level, are treated here as an endemic subspecies as Foudia eminentissima dominates in forested areas and so it is expected that the majority of Fodies recorded represented this species. Finally, 16 non-endemic species may be found, which are predominately confined to the non-forested lower slopes. They are thought to have colonised only recently, since human arrival. The endemic species are thought to have arrived in a double invasion, firstly from mainland Africa, and then a second wave of Madagascan origin (Louette 2000).
In contrast, Anjouan has only one island endemic species, O. capnodes, which was rediscovered in 1992 (Safford 1993), and a further three Comorian endemics: Columba polleni, Turdus bewsheri, and Alectroenas sganzini. A population of A. sganzini also exists on Aldabra, however here it will be considered here as an endemic species to the Comoro Islands.","","","Sara Contu","sara.contu@nhm.ac.uk","Sara Contu",1,125,3625,29

The primary effects of climatic conditions on invertebrate litter communities, and
the secondary effects of different forest types, were distinguished by using the sierra
palm as a control in a natural experiment along an elevational gradient in the Luquillo
Mountains. These mountains have three well-defined forest types along the gradient,
with the palm occurring as stands within each forest.
2.
Palm litter samples were richer in nutrients, particularly phosphorus, than nonpalm
litter, significantly so at higher elevations where leaching would have been expected. In
nonpalm litter, mineral concentrations were significantly lower at higher elevations.
3.
Animal abundance mirrored the pattern of mineral amounts and declined significantly
in mid- and high-altitude forests, but did not decline with increasing elevation in
palm stands. A pulse of post-hurricane litterfall was reflected in the high abundance of
Coleoptera and Isoptera the following year.
4.
The species richness of communities (Margalefs index) declined with increasing elevation
in nonpalm forest litter, but was remarkably similar in palm litter at all elevations.
5.
Palm litter communities were more similar to each other (Sørensens index) than
nonpalm communities, which became less similar with increasing elevation.
6.
The differences observed from the lower slopes to the summits, in animal abundance,
species richness and the uniformity of communities, are better explained by the contribution
of forest composition to the chemical and physical nature of litter and forest
heterogeneity, rather than to direct effects of temperature and rainfall differences.","","","Sara Contu","sara.contu@nhm.ac.uk","Sara Contu",1,72,41184,572

Widespread and rapid losses of tropical rain forests have made understanding the responses of species to rain forest fragmentation an area of major concern. In this study we examined the impacts of habitat fragmentation on the species richness and faunal composition of butterflies in tropical rain forests in Sabah, Borneo. We analysed patterns of both α- and β-diversity to assess the relative importance of differences in patch size, isolation and vegetation structure on the diversity and similarity of species assemblages. We used additive partitioning to assess the relative contributions of intact forest and forest remnants to overall species richness at a landscape scale and we examined which traits of species best predicted their responses to fragmentation.

2. Species richness and diversity in rain forest remnants was significantly positively related to remnant size and significantly negatively related to isolation, in keeping with theories of island biogeography. Species assemblages at different sites were significantly nested, with those species most adversely affected by forest fragmentation having a narrow range of larval host-plants and, to a lesser extent, being large-bodied. No species endemic to Borneo was recorded in forest remnants smaller than 4000 ha, but even the smallest remnant (120 ha) supported species with geographical distributions confined within Sundaland (West Malaysia and the islands of the Sunda Shelf).

3. Although assemblages were significantly nested, they departed substantially from perfect nestedness, with some species recorded only or predominantly in small, relatively depauperate remnants. As a result there was substantial β-diversity among sites, which was related to variation in both fragment size and vegetation structure. At the landscape scale, diversity within sites was less than that between sites, and the majority of the diversity between sites was related to variation in fragment size.

4. Synthesis and applications. Substantial diversity was added to the assemblage of butterflies in Bornean rain forests by virtue of species differences among fragments, which were related mainly to differences in patch size and vegetation structure. The data reported indicate that, despite having lower species richness, relatively small and isolated remnants of rain forest make a substantial contribution to regional diversity. Small isolated forest remnants are generally accorded low conservation status and given little protection, with the result that they often disappear over time because of continued anthropogenic disturbance. The results of this study indicate that the conservation value of small remnants of forest, in particular their contribution to environmental heterogeneity, should not be overlooked.","Map of the sampling sites: Page 969 Fig. 1","","Sara Contu","sara.contu@nhm.ac.uk","Sara Contu",1,11,957,87

Human-altered landscapes dominate the planet, yet little is known about their
capacity to sustain plant functional diversity. Most conservation-orientated studies of
such landscapes focus on species diversity, whereas less attention is given to functional
traits and their conservation.
2
We examine the functional diversity of herbaceous and shrubby plant communities in
three forest habitats (understorey, tree-fall gaps and riverbanks) and three deforested
habitats (pasture, roadside vegetation and pasture riverbanks), each replicated in three
human-dominated landscapes in southern Costa Rica. We focus on six categorical traits
related to forest regeneration, reproduction and dispersal: pollination mechanism, dispersal
mechanism, growth form, fruit type, fruit size and seed size.
3
We compared trait state richness and composition of each trait in forested and
deforested habitats and how three pollination states (bat, bird and bee pollination)
and three dispersal states (fur, bird and monkey dispersal) of conservation interest were
distributed across these landscapes.
4
Only one trait state was missing from forest, and none was missing from deforested
habitats. Understorey and pasture were consistently trait state poor. Forested and
deforested plots differed in trait state composition for all traits. Pasture riverbanks
and road verges were compositionally similar to forest riverbanks and tree-fall gaps,
for multiple traits. There were more compositional similarities between forested and
deforested habitat types when abundance of individuals with a trait state was used as the
basis for similarity measures than when the number of species with each trait state was
used. Bat-, bird- and bee-pollinated plants and plants with bird- and monkey-dispersed
fruits were most common in forest and pasture riverbanks whereas species with
fur-dispersed seeds were more common in all deforested habitats.
5
Functional diversity patterns were inconsistent across habitat types and locations
but overall functional similarity was high between forested and deforested communities.
Patterns of functional diversity were far more variable between habitats and landscapes
than the consistent patterns found previously for species diversity.","","","Sara Contu","sara.contu@nhm.ac.uk","Sara Contu",1,85,61370,722

To evaluate the main correlation patterns among microhabitat variables and species composition

edge and forest interior) with three transects per habitat, and sampled four times between
June 2003 and May 2004 using equal day and night efforts. We measured 12 environmental
variables describing the microclimate, vegetation structure, topography and distance to
forest edge and streams.
After sampling 126 transects (672 man-hours effort) we recorded 1256 amphibians
belonging to 21 species (pasture: 12, edge: 14, and interior: 13 species), and 623 reptiles
belonging to 33 species (pasture: 11, edge: 25, and interior: 22 species). There was a difference
in species composition between pasture and both forest edge and interior habitats. A
high correlation between distance to forest edge and temperature, understorey density,
canopy cover, leaf litter cover, and leaf litter depth was found. There was also a strong relationship
between the composition of amphibian and reptile ensembles and the measured
environmental variables. The most important variables related to amphibian and reptile
ensembles were canopy cover, understorey density, leaf litter cover and temperature.
Based on amphibian and reptile affinity for the habitats along the ecotone, species were
classified into five ensembles (generalist, pasture, forest, forest edge and forest interior species).
We detected six species that could indicate good habitat quality of forest interior and
their disappearance may be an indication of habitat degradation within a fragment, or that
a fragment is not large enough to exclude edge effects. Different responses to spatial and
environmental gradients and different degrees of tolerance to microclimatic changes indicated
that each ensemble requires a different conservation strategy. We propose to maintain
in the Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve the forest remnants in the lowlands that have
gentler slopes and a deep cover of leaf litter, a dense understorey, and high relative humidity
and low temperature, to buffer the effects of edge related environmental changes and

available a GIS tool to calculate accessible habitat.
We hypothesize that accessible habitat will be the
best predictor of the effects of habitat loss and roads
for any species for which roads are a major barrier to
movement. We conducted a case study of the utility
of the accessible habitat concept using a data set of
anuran species richness from 27 ponds near a
motorway. We defined habitat as forest in this
example. We found that accessible habitat was not
only a better predictor of species richness than total
habitat in the landscape or distance to the motorway,
but also that by failing to consider accessible habitat
we would have incorrectly concluded that there was
no effect of habitat amount on species richness.","","","Sara Contu","sara.contu@nhm.ac.uk","Sara Contu",1,36,252,8

""Sampling was performed in three different areas in the city. The first set of sites were situated in the Soignes forest
(4383 ha). This is the largest area of forest in the northern part of Belgium accounting for 60% of the Brussels public green
areas. The second set were in the southeast of Brussels, the relics of Soignes, also with old trees that, prior to its definitive
protection (since 1842), were part of large private estates and were later incorporated into prosperous neighbourhoods of
villas or large forested parks. The third set of sites were in the northwest (Jette) of the city, and originates fromafforestation
in the 18th century of old calcareous limestone quarries. In total we investigated 13 sites that differed in degree of
urbanization (Fig. 1). The percentage of urbanization (Table 1) was objectively calculated for each site and as such used
in the analyses (see urbanization measurements).","In this study we compared ground beetles (Carabidae) from a range of different forest frag-
ments along an urbanization gradient in Brussels, Belgium. We address the following ques-
tions: (i) How does the degree of urbanization in the surrounding habitat affect forest
beetles, and does it interact with the effects of patch size and distance to forest edge? (ii)
Do these factors have a different effect at the level of individual species, habitat affinity
groups or total community? During 2002 we sampled 13 forest plots in 10 forest patches,
ranging in size from 5.27 to 4383 ha. The beetles were captured using transects of pitfall
traps from the edge to a distance of 100 m into each woodland and identified to species
level. Effects of urbanization, forest size and forest edge were evaluated on total species
number, abundance and habitat affinity groups and ten abundant, widespread model cara-
bid species. Overall, the effects of urbanization, forest size and edge effects slightly influ-
enced total species richness and abundance but appeared to have a major effect on
ground beetle assemblages through species specific responses. More urbanized sites had
significantly fewer forest specialists and more generalist species. Large forest fragments
were favoured by forest specialist species while generalist species and species frequently
associated with forest (forest generalists) dominated the smaller forests. Forest edges
mainly harboured generalist species while forest specialist species were more frequent into
the forests if the forest patches were large enough, otherwise they disappeared due to the
destruction or impoverishment of their habitat. Our results show the importance of differ-
entiating between habitat affinity, especially habitat generalists versus specialists, the lat-
ter having a higher value in nature conservation, and merely the quantity of species
represented in human-dominated areas.","Figure 1 and table 1 on page 2587are respectively 'Sampling locations in and around Brussels' and 'Site description of the 13 sampling locations (plot)'","","Sara Contu","sara.contu@nhm.ac.uk","Sara Contu",1,13,1300,100

Highest species complementarity was detected between the prison and coconut plantations, and the prison and primary forest. In conserved habitats (secondary and primary forests) snake diversity doubled, while in the prison and coconut plantations snake abundance increased during the dry season. It is possible that anthropogenic disturbance negatively affects Leptophis ahaetulla, Micrurus dumerili, Oxybelis brevirostris and Tantilla longifrontalis snake species.

responded negatively to human impact, whereas species richness of herbs and shrubs
showed a positive relation. Species turnover (beta-diversity), measured as length of the

species are efficient control agents of crop aphids, and adult hoverflies provide pollination services to wild flowers and
flowering crops. We assessed the density and species richness of hoverflies in 32 calcareous grasslands, which constitute
a semi-natural habitat for adult hoverflies, by means of six transect walks from April to September 2004. Our results
show that local habitat factors and landscape factors influenced hoverfly communities, and that their effects on
hoverfly richness and density were quite contrary. Hoverfly species richness was affected by factors related to resource
heterogeneity such as species richness of flowering plants, area of grassland habitat, and landscape diversity, which all
imply the availability of diverse micro- and macrohabitats for adults and larvae. Hoverfly density, in contrast,
depended on factors related to resource quantity, such as the amount of pollen and nectar resources for adults and the
amount of larval macrohabitats in the surrounding matrix. Therefore, both adult and larval habitat requirements have
to be considered when analysing hoverfly communities in agricultural landscapes. Species guilds responded to specific
land-use types such as annual crops and woodland at different spatial scales, indicating variation in species mobility

influenced plant distributions and diversity patterns in forest understorey communities in much of
Europe and eastern North America. In forests growing on former agricultural land, local species
diversity and community differentiation among sites are generally reduced compared with ancient
forests (i.e. forests with no historical record of agriculture). Yet, no study has determined how the
compositional differences created by former land-use change over time as the forest sites recover
fromformer agricultural use.
2. Here, we resurveyed 78 vegetation plots (half of the plots in ancient and half in post-agricultural
forest) to demonstrate how three decades of forest development have changed the compositional
differences between post-agricultural and ancient forest sites. The impact of land-use history and
survey date was tested on two measures of species diversity and two measure of community divergence.
3. The data indicate that the imprint of former agricultural land use persisted over time, yet not
through compositional stability. Parallel and strong vegetation shifts occurred in both ancient and
post-agricultural forest: the species diversity decreased and local species cover strongly diverged,
which indicates community drift. The observed understorey changes did thus not support the commonly
accepted model of community development in post-agricultural forests, i.e. the diversity did
not increase and the vegetation did not become more similar to the ancient forest vegetation over
time. The changes in species composition were associated with an increase of common, competitive
species at the expense of ancient forest indicator species. The source populations of ancient forest
species have been gradually depleted, so the recovery of post-agricultural forests becomes even more
precarious.
4. Synthesis. While land-use history is likely to persist as the primary predictor of local species
diversity and community divergence, other environmental drivers may additionally structure forest
understorey communities and lead to biotic impoverishment and pervasive species reordering on
the time scale of only decades.","","","Sara Contu","sara.contu@nhm.ac.uk","Sara Contu",1,78,9594,123

richness as a function of seven environmental predictors. Endemic bird richness was greatest in
mature forest at high altitudes whereas endemic butterfly richness peaked at mid-altitudes in disturbed
forest. There was low cross-taxon congruence between areas with high endemic richness; less than 2% of
the island represented areas of overlap between endemic bird and butterfly diversity hotspots. Richness
of both non-endemic birds and non-endemic butterflies was highest in non-forest habitats. Using Generalised

We compared the effects of these two contrasting trajectories of vegetation restoration on bird assemblages in central Spain. Vegetation structure differed in the two restoration trajectories, pine plantations attaining higher tree cover and height (31% and 4.1 m, respectively) but lower strata complexity than secondary shrubland and holm oak woodland (which attained 10% and 1.4 m of tree cover and height, respectively). Bird species richness differed in stands under active or passive restoration trajectories, the former collecting a higher total number of species (4.2 species per 0.78 ha plot) than the latter (3.5 species per plot). The number of forest species increased with vegetation maturity in both restoration trajectories, but especially in stands under active restoration. The occurrence of woodland generalist species increased and of species inhabiting open habitats decreased in actively restored stands, being some of these latter species of high conservation priority in the European context but relatively common at the regional level. Bird species inhabiting pine plantations had broader habitat breadth at the regional level than those inhabiting secondary shrublands and woodlands. Maximum regional density did not differ between both restoration trajectories, but it increased with development of the herbaceous layer only at the secondary succession trajectory. The relative importance of species of European biogeographic origin was higher in mature pine plantations (58.9% of total bird abundance) than in mature holm oak woodlands (34.4%), whereas that of Mediterranean species was considerably higher in the latter (40.1%) than in the former (20%). Bird assemblages of relatively small patches of pine plantations are unable to reflect the regional avifauna, in contrast with the relationships between local and regional assemblage characteristics that can be found in isolated natural forests. We conclude that programs of vegetation restoration should base upon a range of approaches that include passive restoration, active restoration with a variety of tree and shrub species, and mixed models to conciliate agricultural production, vegetation restoration and conservation of target species.","","","Sara Contu","sara.contu@nhm.ac.uk","Sara Contu",1,206,12978,63

(a variation of visual encounter survey) to assess species richness, abundance and
diversity among forest, clear-cut and orchard habitat types in Montagne des
Francais, north Madagascar. Forest sites proved to be very different from clear-
cut and orchard sites with regards to habitat structure. Lizard species richness,
abundance and diversity were significantly lower in clear-cut sites, with only 11%
of the observed forest diversity recorded. This shift in species occurrence suggests
that lizards are particularly sensitive to this type of habitat alteration. Orchard
cultivation did not affect lizard species richness to the same extent, as 56% of the
observed forest diversity was recorded in this habitat type. Furthermore lizard
abundance was significantly higher in orchard habitat. These observations indicate
that although anthropogenic activity can have an adverse effect on the lizard fauna
of a given site, it will seldom lead to a total loss of diversity as species typical of
pristine forest (specialists) are replaced by species adapted to secondary habitats
(often generalists). Our results support the contention that anthropogenic habitat
alteration can have a strong negative influence on lizard communities. Researchers
should continue to identify which species may be lost or become more vulnerable
in future (as a result of population decline) in response to anthropogenic habitat
alteration.","","","Sara Contu","sara.contu@nhm.ac.uk","Sara Contu",1,9,99,11

growth structure and overall forest cover contribute to processes in fragments. Here we examine bird communities in 11
Amazonian rainforest fragments of 1100 ha, beginning before the fragments were isolated in the 1980s, and continuing
through 2007. Using a method that accounts for imperfect detection, we estimated extinction and colonization based on
standardized mist-net surveys within discreet time intervals (12 preisolation samples and 45 post-isolation samples).
Between preisolation and 2007, all fragments lost species in an area-dependent fashion, with loss of as few as ,10% of
preisolation species from 100-ha fragments, but up to 70% in 1-ha fragments. Analysis of individual time intervals revealed
that the 2007 result was not due to gradual species loss beginning at isolation; both extinction and colonization occurred in
every time interval. In the last two samples, 2000 and 2007, extinction and colonization were approximately balanced.
Further, 97 of 101 species netted before isolation were detected in at least one fragment in 2007. Although a small subset of
species is extremely vulnerable to fragmentation, and predictably goes extinct in fragments, developing second growth in
the matrix around fragments encourages recolonization in our landscapes. Species richness in these fragments now reflects
local turnover, not long-term attrition of species. We expect that similar processes could be operating in other fragmented systems that show unexpectedly low extinction.","","","Sara Contu","sara.contu@nhm.ac.uk","Sara Contu",1,11,1309,119

whether they show similar patterns to arable systems nor whether local and/or landscape factors are influential. We
investigated plant community composition in 10 pairs of organic and conventional dairy farms across Ireland in relation to
the local and landscape context. Relationships between plant groups and local factors (farming system, position in field and
soil parameters) and landscape factors (e.g. landscape complexity) were investigated. The percentage cover of unimproved

richness in field edges (but not field centres) increased with increasing landscape complexity (% unimproved grassland)

species richness per site (alpha diversity), as well as spatial and temporal community variation (beta diversity) of bees and

variation in farmland was due to additional species that did not occur in the forest, whereas most species trapped in forest

& Context Understanding the variability of vegetation distribution

the effects of edges on ecological processes. Recent studies
have revealed inconsistencies in the patterns of responses to
edge effects that raise important questions about their determinants.
We investigated the edge effect response patterns
by adapting a recently proposed continuous approach to the
case of small forest fragments in southwestern France.
& Methods We surveyed forest understory vegetation (composition,
species richness, and percent cover) and abiotic
variables (soil temperature, moisture, pH, and canopy openness)
along 28 transects across hard forest edges. We tested
five statistical models to describe the response pattern of
each variable (1) over all transects and (2) per transect. We
then compared the response patterns as a function of the
attributes of the edge (orientation, topography, and adjacent
land cover) and forest patch size.
& Results Over all transects, a general decreasing trend was
observed for all variables as the distance from the edge
increased. In the individual transects, we evidenced a large
variability in the response patterns that was not related to
edge attributes or to patch size.","","Alignier_DATA.xlsx","Sara Contu","sara.contu@nhm.ac.uk","Sara Contu",1,560,71120,127

that small mammal assemblages differ considerably among fragments types (urban vs rural),
with lack of endemic species from urban fragments and with high proportion of introduced

than in urban fragments. In urban areas small mammal abundance and richness were not
correlated with any of the explanatory variables assessed (woody cover, flora heterogeneity,

livelihoods of local communities. However, the sustainable management of these forests is a complex task requiring the
successful juggling of the different interests of local stakeholders, including fulfilling their economic, social and ecological
demands. Birds were chosen as the indicator of biodiversity with which to evaluate the effects of forest management
activities. A research study was conducted in 2005 during the birds breeding season in five different habitats (primary
and secondary forests, plantation, agroforestry and brushwood) using the point sampling method. A total of 23 species
were recorded. According to the various diversity indices employed, the best habitats for species richness were areas of
agroforestry, while primary forests were found to be the best habitats in terms of species abundance. In contrast, the lowest
bird diversity was observed in plantations due to their structural homogeneity. In addition, habitat suitability was
assessed according to both horizontal and vertical structural parameters and tested using five selected indicator bird species.
The results reveal a link between birds and vegetation, with abundance of old trees, availability of deadwood and
habitat understorey density found to be the most important indicators of bird survival. Our research findings highlight
that it is imperative to protect existing primary forests which are genetic diversity hotspots for endemic species such as
Dendrocopos leucopterus. Although areas under agroforestry were primarily found to be relatively promising habitats in
terms of species richness, these intensively managed ecosystems may also be useful for simultaneously fulfilling the
needs of local people, if such projects are carefully planned and managed.","","","Sara Contu","sara.contu@nhm.ac.uk","Sara Contu",1,5,115,23

We evaluated the extent to which species richness of arable plants in the Rolling Pampas of Argentina is
determined by field position (fencerow, edge and centre) and crop type, at both field (local) and landscape
scales. Plant richness was assessed in maize, soybean and wheatsoybean fields across four landscape
types differing in spatial complexity, as defined by percentage area devoted to cropland. Species richness
was hierarchically nested within landscape types, field positions and crop types. Landscape richness
(-diversity, the cumulative number of species in a set of fields) was additively partitioned into two
components, one for local richness (²-diversity, the mean number of species per field) and one denoting
differences in species composition among fields (¡-diversity, where ¡ = 

determinant of landscape-scale plant richness. Overall, -diversity declined from fencerows, through
field edges to field centres, but was unaffected by crop type. Spatial variation in species composition
(¡-diversity), rather than species packing within fields (²-diversity), accounted for most of the variation
in arable -diversity. Higher ¡-diversity in field edges than in field centres suggested that propagule
dispersal from fencerow vegetation may create a mass effect onto certain crop types. Shifts in -diversity
of major perennial life-forms (chamaeophytes and phanerophytes) between field positions and crop types
reflected the contrasting disturbance regimes affecting plant communities of fencerows and cultivated

conserve farmland biodiversity. Moreover, maintaining landscape heterogeneity to support elevated ¡-

Current research investigating bee assemblage distribution along urban-rural gradients struggles to gain synthesis, as sites, cities and regions studied vary between studies. Since bees use a variety of areas for their nesting and foraging resources over the urban-rural gradient, increasing study of the types of sites sampled provides a firmer understanding of how bee assemblages respond to urbanisation. Bees were sampled at 33 canal side and parkland sites across Birmingham, UK, with sweep netting and pan trapping undertaken between April-September in 2011 and April-September in 2012. Abundance and diversity metrics were tested for variation between land-use types using ANOVA and rarefaction, and applied to mixed-models to test for relationships with landscape type (m2 built space and agricultural land within 250 m, 500 m, 1 km, 1.5 km, 2 km, 2.5 km, 3 km, 3.5 km and 4 km of each site) and local site variables (floral availability, level of management and exposure). I found that in canal sides and parkland overall bee abundance showed a significant positive relationship with built space, whilst rarefaction indicated species richness was greater in rural areas. Furthermore, division of abundance metrics between genera and species showed increased abundance in several bumblebee species to greater built space, whilst Andrena spp. showed a negative relationship with built space. This chapter presents further evidence that the variation in bee abundance between land-use types is species-specific, supporting recent studies that indicate highly disturbed urban environments filter bee species and determine bee assemblages. This chapter also highlights the importance of site type replication within regions as these results contrast with a study of cemeteries and churchyards in the same region, underlining the importance of sampling all potential habitat sites along urban-rural gradients.","","","Sara Contu","sara.contu@nhm.ac.uk","Sara Contu",1,36,2700,75

Multile sampling methods were used in this study (they pooled the complementary captures from the different methods and strata for all analyses):
a) Ground hand sampling ('looking down' of Coddington
et al. 1991): two experienced persons sampled for one
hour at night with headlights, exploring all structures
below knee level, resulting in one sample per person, two
samples per site.
b) Aerial hand sampling ('looking up' of Coddington et al.
1991): one person sampled for one hour at night,
exploring all structures from knee height upwards to
overhead arm's reach; i.e., lower vegetation, resulting in 1
sample per site.
c) Beating: Three persons striking vegetation at any
reachable level (i.e., lower vegetation) with a stick,
collecting the spiders falling on a 50 x 50-cm tray held
below, for one hour. Twenty beating points made one
sample. Depending on the person sampling, a different
number of samples per site (3-9) resulted.
d) Pitfall trapping: Ten traps per site were installed to
capture active ground spiders for one week, usually
resulting in 10 samples per site, with a few failures. Traps
were 330 ml PE cups with an opening diameter of 7.5 cm,
filled with 100 ml of 4% formaldehyde solution and
protected against rain by transparent plastic plates.","In many tropical areas of the world, pristine forests have become rare. Nevertheless, due to shifts in the human
population the area covered by secondary forests is increasing. These forests may harbor a rich flora and fauna and are
considered to be main refuges for species of primary forests. However, this issue is far from clear. To assess the
conservation value of secondary forests in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, we compared the diversity of spiders in differently
aged secondary forests with old-growth forests. Within a larger project treating several invertebrate taxa, we sampled
spiders using a standard protocol in 24 sites of three successional stages (58, 1520, 3050 years old) and old-growth
forests (. 100 years untouched) in two nature reserves. We describe the diversity and structure of the assemblages using
morphospecies and genera and analyze richness at the genus level. Generic richness and diversity showed no differences
between successional stages; i.e., did not increase from the youngest to older forests, but guild diversity did increase. The
youngest stage showed the highest variability in generic composition, and the turnover of genera and species was strong
between the younger forests (520 years old) and forests older than 30 years. High alpha diversity, high turnover among
sites and the lack of differences in richness between stages support the value of secondary forests for species conservation in
the region studied.","Map of the study area: Figure 1 page 53","","Sara Contu","sara.contu@nhm.ac.uk","Sara Contu",1,8,3528,441

biodiversity. Determining the impacts of forest disturbance and fragmentation on tropical biotas is therefore a
central goal of conservation biology. We focused on bird communities in the interior (>100 m from forest edge)
of forest fragments (300, 600, and 1200 ha) in the lowlands of Papua New Guinea and compared them with
those in continuous forest. We surveyed bird communities using point counts, mist-netting, and random walks,
and measured habitat and microclimate characteristics at each site. We also surveyed leaf-dwelling arthropods,
butterflies, and ants, and obtained diet samples from birds to examine food availability and food preferences. We
recorded significantly fewer bird species per point in the 300-ha forest fragment than in other study sites. Overall, we
recorded 80, 84, and 88 species, respectively, in forest fragments, and 102 in continuous forest. Frugivores (especially
large frugivores) and insectivores had lower species richness in forest fragments than continuous forest. Our results
did not support the food scarcity hypothesis, that is, the decline of insectivorous birds in forest fragments is caused
by an impoverished invertebrate prey base. We also found no significant differences among forest fragments and
continuous forest in microclimates of forest interiors. Rather, we found that microhabitats preferred by sensitive
birds (i.e., 30% of species with the strongest preferences for continuous forest) were less common in forest fragments
(19%31% of points) than in continuous forest (86% of points). Our results suggest that changes in microhabitats
may make forest fragments unsuitable for sensitive species. However, limited dispersal capabilities could also make
some species of birds less likely to disperse and occupy fragments. In addition, impoverished food resources, size
of the forest fragment, or hunting pressure could contribute to the absence of large frugivorous birds in forest
fragments. The forest fragments in our study, preserved as village-based protected areas, were not large enough
to sustain the bird communities found in continuous forest. However, because these fragments still contained
numerous bird species, preservation of such areas can be an important component of management strategies to
conserve rainforests and birds in Papua New Guinea.","","","Sara Contu","sara.contu@nhm.ac.uk","Sara Contu",2,8,864,216

To explore the effectiveness of management-based strategies on establishing sustainable rangeland development, we compared the response of temporarily removing grazing from rangelands ecosystems to those under a continuous heavy grazing regime. Results indicated that ungrazed sites had both higher biomass production and plant species composition than grazed sites. Ungrazed plots produced more than fourfold herbaceous biomass production than continuously grazed plots (p < 0.001). Extent of plant cover was 20% greater in ungrazed plots than grazed plots (33.5 & 13.5%, respectively). Furthermore areas protected from heavy grazing had over 200% greater species composition. Thus, protection from grazing can increase forage production and species composition, but may not necessarily improve plant species available for livestock utilization. A more balanced grazing management approach is recommended to achieve an optimal condition of biomass production (quantity), vegetation cover, quality and available forage species that contribute to proving livestock grazing conditions.","pp. 682-684","","Sylvester Choimes","argyrios.choimes12@imperial.ac.uk","Sylvester Choimes",2,8,292,73

This paper compares the impact of mowing and grazing on butterfly biodiversity in two S Italian (Campania) grasslands, at Campo Somma (CS) and Pianoro di Prada (PP) located at an identical altitude of 850 m. These grasslands have an area of approximately 6 ha each and are at a 3 km distance from each other. They share similar climate and are both surrounded by woods, mainly of sweet chestnut. CS is managed for haying and is mown once a year, in June. PP is used for sheep and cattle grazing. Weekly transects were made from April to September in 2008 and 2009, during the butterfly flight activity. We analysed data from eight monthly transects by KruskalWallis and MannWhitney tests. We observed 45 butterfly species at PP, and 28 at CS. Diversity indexes were significantly higher at PP, whereas evenness was similar. The monthly comparisons of species richness showed that, except for April, PP values were always significantly higher. Species abundance was significantly higher at PP in June, July and August. In all months, except in April, the ShannonWiener index was also significantly higher at PP, as was Simpsons index in May, June and September. Domi- nance index differed significantly only in May, June and September, whereas evenness was never significantly different between the two grasslands. These data show that, as concerns butterflies, the impact of mowing was much stronger than that of grazing.","pp. 1733-1739

High use trails showed lower values of plant cover and diversity of vegetation species, as well as soil respiration and some enzyme activities (phosphatase, b-glucosidase and dehydrogenase) than low use trails. In addition, the effects of trampling spatially extended further from these high use trails than from low use trails. Statistical analysis showed that some microbiological (basal respiration, dehydrogenase activity and b-glucosidase activity) and vegetal parameters (plant cover and diversity) may be established as a set of indicators for the evaluation of soil quality on these areas subjected to human trampling.

Nevertheless, they have not yet been exhaustively included in the assessment of Sustainable Forest Management. This work aimed at evaluating the effects of forest management on epiphytic lichens in coppiced forests, exploring the spatial patterns of diversity and the composition of communities. Moreover, the goal was to compare the performance of four potential indicators for monitoring the effects of forest management on epiphytic lichens: total lichen diversity, species associated with intensive management, species associated with aged coppiced woodlands and Indicator Species Ratio (ISR). In humid Mediterranean Liguria, 50 sampling units were chosen in Castanea sativa and deciduous Quercus spp. forests subjected to different forest management practices: intensively managed coppice and aged coppice/high forest. The effect of forest management was evident in terms of species composition, since it was possible to find significantly associated species for each of the two management types. At each sampling site, the four indicators were calculated using Indicator Value Analysis and compared through correspondence analysis. The ISR was shown to be a more effective indicator, being independent of floristic composition and the occurrence of rare species.","pp. 629-631","","Sylvester Choimes","argyrios.choimes12@imperial.ac.uk","Sylvester Choimes",1,158,30968,196

Despite the ecological importance of this group to pasture ecosystem functioning, still little is known about its relationship with grazing management activities. We evaluated the conservation value of protected areas for dung beetle diversity by comparing two different management conditions of Mediterranean savanna in central Spain. Four different sites with wild herbivory (red deer, roe deer) were sampled inside the Caban ̃eros National Park, and four sites with traditional agrosilvopastoral management were sampled in a sheep farm near the park. The dung beetle species richness was similar between savanna conditions, but the total dung beetle abundance and biomass were considerably greater in the park grasslands than in the grasslands of the sheep farm. Dung beetle species composition, species dominance, and abundance by functional groups from both park and farm sites were different, despite the high similarity among the sampled sites in both hydric content and dung availability. Onthophagus maki (Illiger 1803) and O. furcatus (Fabricius 1781) were the dominant species in the park, while O. furcatus, Aphodius foetidus (Herbst 1783), and Caccobius schreberi L. were the dominant species on the farm. Species richness and abundance of telecoprids were higher in the park than on the farm. Abundance of paracoprids was also higher in the park than on the farm, while no differences in species richness and abundance of endocoprids were observed between both conditions. These results suggest that management activities such as plowing and the use of veterinary substances affect soil structure and dung quality and could be important factors that alter dung beetle assemblages in terms of composition, abundance, and biomass on traditional farms.","pp. 138-140","","Sylvester Choimes","argyrios.choimes12@imperial.ac.uk","Sylvester Choimes",1,23,851,37

MechanicalmanagementofforestfuelsisincreasinglyusedintheEuro-Mediterraneanregionin response to the abandonment of traditional agroforestry and the concurrent increase in fire hazard. Although fuel management may have positive side effects for biodiversity, its long-term impacts remain largely unknown.
2. We used a 70-year post-management chronosequence to investigate the influence of time since fuel management and management frequency on bird assemblages in cork oak Quercus suber for- ests.
3. Fuel management strongly affected bird species richness, abundances and assemblage composi- tion, with rapid changes often occurring during the first 1020 years, followed in the next decades by a slow convergence to pre-management levels.
4. In winter, overall species richness and abundance, and that of frugivores and shrub foragers, were negatively affected by recent and recurrent management, only recovering in stands unmanaged for >50 years. In spring, insectivore abundance and the richness and abundance of shrub foragers declined immediately following management, increased to a maximum about 20 years later, and declined thereafter. Breeding granivores and ground foragers were the only groups that benefitted from fuel management. There were no overall effects on species of conservation concern, although a few species with unfavourable status benefitted from fuel management.
5. Synthesis and applications. Our study confirmed that mechanical fuel management has positive effects on some early-successional bird species of conservation concern, although its effects were limited. These benefits should be compared with the strong negative impacts on key bird species such as wintering frugivores, which play a pivotal role in ecosystems by promoting seed dispersal. To reconcile the positive and negative aspects, fuel management should be used to create heteroge- neous mosaics of forest patches encompassing a range of sizes (10100 ha) and successional stages of understorey vegetation, including stands undisturbed for >50 years. This management strategy will likely maintain conditions for a wide range of species with contrasting ecological requirements while also reducing fire hazard.","pp. 633-636","","Sylvester Choimes","argyrios.choimes12@imperial.ac.uk","Sylvester Choimes",1,48,2592,54

The common forestry practice of removing understory vegetation to prevent fire hazard (fuel management) probably has the side-effect of ameliorating these consequences, but it is uncertain whether it effectively restores habitats for early-successional species. Here we examine the influence of time since fuel management and management frequency on butterfly assemblages, using a chronose- quence of cork oak (Quercus suber) stands spanning about 70 years. Overall species richness increased immediately after management and abundances peaked about 23 years later, while both declined there- after for about 1020 years to pre-disturbance levels. Richness and abundances were also much higher in recurrently managed stands. Most life history groups showed successional trends similar to the overall species richness and abundances, though consistent positive effects of fuel management were only observed for species with univoltine life cycle, herbaceous layer feeding, larval overwintering, and inter- mediate body size. Individual species were largely associated with recent and recurrent management, though a few specialists occurred most often in undisturbed stands. These findings suggest that fuel man- agement at <10 years intervals is strongly positive for butterfly assemblages in landscapes under land abandonment. However, to maintain the overall forest biodiversity it is critical that patches of undis- turbed habitat are also retained at the landscape scale.","pp. 15-17","","Sylvester Choimes","argyrios.choimes12@imperial.ac.uk","Sylvester Choimes",1,45,1890,42

coffee production in Colombia. Twelve farms were selected and classified into four
management types: forest, polygeneric shade coffee, monogeneric shade coffee, and
sun coffee (unshaded coffee monocultures).
2. At each of the farms, four treatment subplots were established at the corners of
each of 10 25 m 2 plots: (i) twig augmentation (adding 10 empty bamboo twigs); (ii)
litter augmentation (tripling existing litter profile); (iii) twig and litter augmentation;
and (iv) no manipulation control, for a total of 480 subplots. A twig addition experiment
was also performed on coffee bushes.
3. The results showed significantly more ant colonies in the forest and monogeneric
shade coffee litter augmentation plots after 4 months. Litter-nesting ant species richness
was higher in all three shade systems than in the sun coffee. The identities of ants
nesting on coffee bushes were different from those in the soil level litter. Fewer species
nested in bamboo twigs placed in litter in the most intensive systems.
4. More ants nested in the resource addition treatments, and more ant species were
found in forested habitats; however, a single mechanism cannot explain the observed
patterns. It was concluded that a combination of bottom-up and top-down effects might
lead to the loss of associated fauna with the intensification of these agroecosystems.","","","Susy Echeverría-Londoño","s.echeverria-londono@nhm.ac.uk","Susy Echeverría-Londoño",4,48,1248,104

a Neotropical rainforest and to test four sampling methods. Bee diversity and richness
were studied in northeastern Medellin (Antioquia, Colombia; 900-1100 m in altitude)
over six months using a chronosequence with four successional stages (abandoned
pastures, low shrubs, secondary forest, and mature forest). Bees were intensively and
systematically sampled, using the following methods: entomological net, Malaise trap,
Methyl Salicylate, and Van Somer trap with decomposed fresh water fish. A total of
15.356 specimens were collected, belonging to four families and 287 species,
representing 62% of all bee species found in Colombia. About 50% of all individuals
sampled were stingless social bees (Apidae, Meliponini). Trigona (Trigona) fulviventris was
the most abundant species (-10%) in the survey. Augochlora and Megachile were the most
specious genera. The pasture and secondary forest showed high values of diversity and
richness and were significantly higher than those of the mature forest and low shrubs.
In all successional stages, except in the mature forest, the number of new species
collected in each sample period approached zero and the species accumulation curves
tended to stabilize as time and sampling area increased. The net was the most efficient
method in all successional stages, except in the forest, where most bee species and
individuals were collected with the Van Somer trap. However, a higher percentage
(50%) of rare species was collected with the Malaise trap. The number of new species
collected in each sampled period and the species accumulation curves suggest that our
survey was nearly sufficient to estimate the bee diversity in these early successional
stages, but insufficient to study the mature forest apifauna. Due to the high efficiency
of the Van Somer trap to attract bees in the forest, this trap should be used regularly
in additional bee surveys in tropical rain forests. We also summarize the bee surveys in
Colombia and highlight the importance of using other less common sampling methods
to study bees from tropical ecosystems.","","","Susy Echeverría-Londoño","s.echeverria-londono@nhm.ac.uk","Susy Echeverría-Londoño",4,48,6624,552

in improving restoration practices. This study sought to evaluate the success of the 20-year-old ecological rehabilitation
program at El Cerrej´on, one of the worlds largest open-pit coal mining operation located in a vulnerable
dry tropical forest region of Colombia. This study compared ant assemblages in 13 sites classified along a gradient
of rehabilitation sites aged 014 years, as well as in three forest reference areas. Two sampling methods (pitfall
traps and visual search) were conducted during three sampling periods. Seed removal by ants was also quantified
at seven of the 13 sites using seed bait from native plants. Eighty-two ant species, belonging to 29 genera, were found.
The highest number of ant species were found inside the forests. Ant species richness increased with rehabilitation
age of sites, along with higher canopy cover and milder soil temperature. Rehabilitation actions enhancing these
ecological factors might, therefore, favor the presence of wild fauna such as ants. The oldest area (14 years) was the
most similar to the forests, both in terms of functional ant groups (guilds) and dominant species. Seed movement was
highest in the 14-year-old restored area and was similar to that of the forests, suggesting that this ecological function
has been partially restored and that the movement of seed dispersal agents across the landscape would be enhanced.","Page 179: Schematic map of sampling sites","","Susy Echeverría-Londoño","s.echeverria-londono@nhm.ac.uk","Susy Echeverría-Londoño",1,13,1066,82

Epiphyte richness and biomass was similar in all fragments, except one bottom-valley fragment, despite large differences in anthropogenic-induced forest structure. We hypothesize that epiphyte resilience to disturbance in these dry oak forest fragments is due to tolerance of the local epiphyte species to desiccation, overriding micro-climatic differences between forest fragments of different structure.","Page 163: Figure 1.

We tested hypotheses concerning the flocks daily activity and the co-occurrences of species within them. We recorded 75 species, and the species number per flock varied from 4 to 21. Our data suggest that habitat affects the number of flocks but not their species number, and that the activity of flocks is similar throughout the day. In addition, the association of birds in flocks is affected by interspecific facilitation, with some species co-occurrences found more times than expected by chance. We hypothesize that some tanager species could have a role in flock cohesion. We witnessed 2 predator attacks upon flocks, a number of agonistic interactions among flock members, and squirrels following bird flocks.

We evaluated edge effects on tropical cloud forest anurans in three landscapes with a different degree of anthropogenic disturbance, and their relationships with eight environmental variables. On each landscape we set up 12 permanent transects (two per habitat type: streams in pastures, pastures, the outer limit of the pastures with the forest, the internal edge of the forest, the forest interior and streams inside the forest) and surveyed them using an equal effort. After an effort of 162 man-hours we recorded a total of 251 anurans of eight species. Richness was higher in the forest (seven species) than in pasture (four species). Most species of the ensemble (75%) inhabited the forest habitats, whereas 50% of the anuran species inhabited the pasture. Slope and distance to streams influenced the distribution of all modeled Pristimantis species, although this genus exhibits direct development and doesnt require bodies of water for its reproduction. The canopy cover had a high explanatory power (through beta regressors) on the presence of anuran species in the microhabitat; whereas temperature and relative humidity did not, suggesting that temperature and relative humidity may be less important for frog distributions along pasture-forest gradients in cloud forest landscapes. The anthropogenic disturbance in the landscape, rather than the edge effects, affects the presence of two rare species (Pristimantis ptochus and Pristimantis kelephas) suggesting that these species display a high degree of sensitivity to the transformation of the cloud forest. Future cloud forest management research needs to incorporate anthropogenic disturbance effects, because it strongly interacts with edge and matrix effects, affecting the habitat quality and the persistence of species in the landscape.","","","Susy Echeverría-Londoño","s.echeverria-londono@nhm.ac.uk","Susy Echeverría-Londoño",1,6,48,8

Both bird richness and abundance were related to wetland size while densities were related to varied factors particular to each species. Conservation of wetland birds in the Sabana de Bogotá is possible due to the differences in both vegetation covers and landscape characteristics in the remaining wetlands.

It was also assessed whether some taxa could be used as diversity surrogates. A total of 6,765 individuals grouped in 290 morphospecies were collected. Species richness in all groups was lower in highly transformed vegetation types (pasture, sugarcane crop) than in native ones (forests). In contrast, there were no clear tendencies of b diversity among vegetation types. Considering sampling patches, 0.142% of the variation in a diversity of one taxonomic group could be explained from the a
diversity of another, and 0.233% of the variation of b diversity of a given taxon was explained by that in other groups. Contrary to recent findings, we concluded that patterns of a diversity are more congruent than patterns of b diversity. This fact could be attributed to a sampling effect that promotes congruence in a diversity and to a lack of a clear regional ecological gradient that could promote congruent patterns of b diversity. We did not find evidence for an ideal diversity surrogate although diversity patterns of predatory ants had the greatest congruencies. These results support earlier multi-taxon evaluations in that conservation planning should not be based on only one leaf litter arthropod group.","","","Susy Echeverría-Londoño","s.echeverria-londono@nhm.ac.uk","Susy Echeverría-Londoño",1,39,11310,290

The simplification of agricultural landscapes through the increase in cropped area has caused
the loss of habitats for many species that fulfil important ecosystem services such as pest control
and production. Evidence for detrimental effects on ecosystem services is scarce, particularly in
tropical regions.
2. We studied the effect of the percentage of cropped land in the landscape and altitude in tropical
agro-ecosystems in relation to crop pest regulation and yield. In the Colombian Andes, we established
potato Solanum tuberosum plots along gradients of altitude and increasing proportion of
cropped area to assess the effects on herbivores, their natural enemies, potato production and overall
biodiversity.
3. Increasing altitude and percentage cropped land reduced the richness and abundance of herbivores
and their natural enemies, except for the specialist Guatemalan potato moth Tecia solanivora,
which showed the opposite response.
4. Potato yield was negatively affected by the presence of the Guatemalan potato moth, which
increased in density as the percentage of cropped land and altitude increased. Other herbivores and
natural enemies did not affect yield.
5. Synthesis and applications. Tropical landscapes at lower altitude or with smaller areas of
cropped land suffered less from the presence of the potato moth, which had a negative effect on
yield. Our results suggest that conservation of natural habitats like the endangered Andean
ecosystems would benefit farmers through ecosystem services such as reduced pest damage, higher
yield and increased functional biodiversity.","","Martínez & Poveda_2007_Herbivores_potato.xls, Martínez &Poveda _2007_Parasitoids_potato.xls, Martínez& Poveda_2007","Susy Echeverría-Londoño","s.echeverria-londono@nhm.ac.uk","Susy Echeverría-Londoño",2,34,10268,604

The consequences of these practices on the structure and composition of carabids on Andean ecosystems are not well understood. In the northeastern Colombian Andes, we studied changes in the composition and diversity of carabid assemblages in four different types of plant coverages affected by disturbance. We found a considerable change among plant coverage types in terms of carabid composition, diversity, and abundances; where these three ecological parameters showed a strongly structure and similar patterns observed principally in boreal forests. We found that carabid diversity and abundance were higher in the regenerating forests as the oak forest and gallery forest than in the natural forest as the undisturbed forest. Stenotopic species were associated with undisturbed forest, in contrast, eurytopic species were more abundant and associated with the oak forest. Therefore, the disturbance caused by the logging involved a loss of specialist species and an increase of generalist species in the disturbed areas. The local patterns caused by the disturbance might be related to the regional distribution of carabids species. Due to strongly association of some species with particular habitats, the regional distribution of specialist and generalist species might be determined by abiotic and biotic conditions as a result of different events that lead the dispersal of carabids species.","Geographic records page 20Habitat description page 21","","Susy Echeverría-Londoño","s.echeverria-londono@nhm.ac.uk","Susy Echeverría-Londoño",1,7,147,21

In this work we evaluated whether beetles of the Scarabaeoidea superfamily may be used as bioindicators of anthropogenic disturbance of Amazonian terra firme rain forests, in order to provide guidelines for monitoring strategies of the Amacayacu National Park. We considered three different levels of anthropogenic disturbance (i.e. low, medium, high) in 12 transects (four in each intervention level), and caught all beetle species of this superfamily. Three interception traps, two light traps, three pitfalls and four bottle fruit traps were used per transect, as well as manual catch. In total, 593 individuals belonging to 92 species, 44 genera and seven families were collected. Scarabaeidae (n=232, 27 spp.) and Dynastidae (n=161, 26 spp.) were the families with the highest number of individuals and species, while Aphodiidae, Cetoniidae and Geotrupidae exhibited the lowest. The most abundant species per family were Ateuchus sp. (33.2%) from Scarabaeidae, Cyclocephala verticalis (55.9%) from Dynastidae, Astaena sp.

Results showed that the number of species and individuals increased with the anthropogenic disturbance. The Margalef and Shannon indexes also revealed that the highest richness and equity occurred in the high-disturbed site, respectively. Dynastidae exhibited the highest number of exclusive species per gradient, while Scarabaeidae shared most of its species. Ten species were recorded in the three disturbance levels, 26 species in two and 56 species were exclu- sive to one level. The most abundant species Chaetodus asuai (Hybosoridae) presented a significant decrease in the number of individuals as disturbance increased, while an inverse relationship occurred for C. verticalis (Dynastidae).

Despite the obvious dependence of plant-dwelling arthropods on plants, there are few empirical tests to show if restoring the plants also restores the plant-dwelling arthropods, or if other factors inhibit recolonisation. This paper tests the congruence in reassembly trajectory between these two groups and the role of dispersal capabilities on arthropod recolonisation, using Hemiptera. Plants and arthropods were sampled along a chronosequence of individual mine pits representing increasing ages since restoration works, and surrounding unmined forest. Changes in the richness, composition and structural complexity of the vegetation are described. These data are compared to Hemiptera sampled by beating and vacuuming over 18 months. Following the initial establishment of vegetation, the richness of plant species remains at a plateau as pits age, and below that found in unmined forest. In contrast, some structural attributes of the vegetation in pits become more similar to the forest with time. As pits age, dead vegetation below 20 cm thickens and living midstorey vegetation thins. Plant species composition changes with time but is not tracking directly toward unmined forest. The abundance and richness of hemipteran species remain constant as pits age (􏰅74.5 species), at a similar value to that in the forest. Recolonisation by Hemiptera that are brachypterous (with permanently reduced wings) is markedly slower than for winged taxa. That said, the compositions of plant and hemipteran species follow a similar trajectory after mining (i.e., there is high congruence between the two taxa). Hemipteran species composition in the oldest pits sampled (9-year-old) is not tracking directly toward that found in unmined forest. We conclude that for plant-dwelling arthropods, the early stages of reassembly are characterised by a high abundance of a generalist species and the slow recolonisation by specialist taxa and fauna with limited dispersal abilities (e.g., brachypters).

Agroforestry systems such as shaded coffee plantations are known to be more compatible with biodiversity conservation than other, more drastic, land transformations. In recent times, however, modernization of coffee cultivation has influenced its conservation values adversely. We evaluated adult butterfly diversity in 12 coffee plantations around a protected area (PA) in the Western Ghats, India. We sampled 25 transects that varied in distance from the PA and in proportion of silver oak Grevillea robusta, an exotic timber species. We also had two transects within the PA. We used a combination of line transects and fruit bait traps to sample butterflies. Micro-climatic variables (temperature, humidity and light intensity) and other habitat variables (e.g. canopy cover, tree diversity, herb species richness) were recorded for each transect. We analyzed the effect of these variables on the abundance and species richness of butterflies, overall as well as in different families, feeding guilds and size classes. Proximity to the PA significantly influenced the abundance and richness of butterflies in coffee planta- tions, with transects close to the PA having higher abundance and richness than transects further away. Also, in terms of butterfly species composition, similarity to forest declined with increasing distance. Among the habitat variables, only canopy cover had a significant effect on abundance and richness, and the effect was negative. These patterns, with some exceptions, were also reflected for different families and feeding guilds. The proportion of silver oak had no apparent effect on butterflies. This study demonstrates that coffee plantations can act as a buffer for butterfly fauna within a certain radius of a PA. They have great potential as auxiliary tools and can significantly complement conservation efforts that are currently centered on PAs.","","","Susan Emerson","s.emerson@nhm.ac.uk","Susan Emerson",1,13,1209,93

However, capture rates and probabilities may be influenced by habitat structure, which invalidates comparisons of relative abundance among habitat types. To assess whether pitfall traps provide accurate reflections of density and whether habitat structure affects capture probabilities, we trapped at six sites in various jarrah-forest habitat types in south-western Australia, then intensively searched 150-m2 total-removal plots around each pitfall grid to obtain absolute densities of reptiles. Pitfall captures were significantly correlated with numbers on total-removal plots for Hemiergis initialis and Lerista distinguenda, indicating that pitfall traps provided accurate reflections of density for these species. Capture probabilities of H. initialis and L. distinguenda and all reptiles combined showed no significant correlations with any structural variables, indicating that capture probabilities were consistent across sites. We conclude that trapping provided accurate estimates of relative abundance for some species and that capture probabilities were not influenced by vegetation structure. Because many studies use trapping to estimate abundances among habitat types, we encourage researchers to investigate how vegetation structure influences capture probabilities, so that general patterns can be determined; we also suggest improvements for any future studies.","","see folder ""SE2 Craig et al studies functional trait information""","Susan Emerson","s.emerson@nhm.ac.uk","Susan Emerson",1,6,102,17

Pitfall traps were used to sample arthropods in three study areas, each of which included an organic vineyard, an integrated vineyard and a natural vegetation reference habitat. Overall arthropod morphospecies richness was highest in natural sites, fol- lowed by organic vineyards and then integrated vineyards. The same trend was seen for predators, saprophages and phytophages. The ability of organic vineyards to sustain more morphospecies than integrated vineyards were par- tially due to higher non-crop vegetation complexity and less intense management in the organic vineyards. Arthropod assemblages were similar in organic and integrated vine- yards, while both land-uses differed greatly from natural sites. Variation among natural vegetation assemblages in different study areas was also much greater than among assemblages of cultivated sites. Organic vineyard manage- ment has the potential to make an important contribution to arthropod conservation in the CFR at the field scale. However, at the landscape scale, natural habitat supports a much wider variety of morphospecies, and the preservation of natural fragments in the vineyard landscape may be the most effective measure to increase biodiversity in the winelands.","","","Susan Emerson","s.emerson@nhm.ac.uk","Susan Emerson",1,10,3890,389

By using 22-24 pairs of cameras placed for 49 days in both areas, we photographed 9 of 13 probably occurring large (> 1 kg) mammal species identified in a country-wide review. Of the 9 species that appeared in photographs, 4 also were identified genetically from simultaneously collected scat samples. Two species identified by the genetic sample were not photographed. Photo rates differed between areas and corresponded to independent abundance estimates for snow leopards (from fecal genetic individual identification), and for argali (Ovus ammon) and Siberian ibex (Capra ibex; both from visual surveys). The photo rates of ungulates were highest, and those for large carnivores were lowest, in the ""strictly protected area,'' which suggested an effect from illicit control of predators by occupants of the surrounding villages. In contrast, in the unprotected area, where hunting was managed and local residents and visitors were few, the species diversity and photo rates for most species were higher. Our use of ancillary camera-trap photos was valuable for authenticating species presence and, sometimes, for documenting differences in species abundances between areas with different conservation histories. In addition, this study indicates the importance of continued outreach and collaboration with villagers to ensure effective wildlife conservation within Kyrgyz national parks.","","","Susan Emerson","s.emerson@nhm.ac.uk","Susan Emerson",1,46,598,13

There is increasing evidence that passive faunal recolonisation of restored areas can take decades or even centuries, reducing benefits to biodiversity fromrestoration. Thus, there is a need to develop restoration and management strategies that facilitate and accelerate faunal recolonisation. This requires identification of habitat features that act as filters to slow or prevent recolonisation and whether those filters are temporally unidirectional or dynamic.
2. We investigated successional patterns of reptiles and mammals in restored mine-pits in southwestern Australia to identify potential filters to faunal recolonisation. We sampled reptiles and small mammals using 30 trapping grids across each of four restoration ages (4, 8, 12 and 17-years old) and unmined forest and assessed vegetation structure to identify animalhabitat relationships.
3. Mammal communities in restored areas converged on unmined forest communities as restoration matured, and all species recolonised rapidly, indicating there were no filters to mammal recolonisation. In contrast, reptile communities did not converge in the same way, indicating there were filters that slowed or prevented reptile recolonisation. We identified three reptile species that were slow, or failed, to recolonise restored areas and a fourth species that rapidly recolonised but disappeared as restoration matured. We identified low coarse woody debris (CWD) volumes and high overstorey stem densities as likely filters; the former is a unidirectional filter thatwill decrease gradually over long time frames, possibly centuries, while the latter is a dynamic filter that fluctuates in its intensity over short time frames of years.
4. Synthesis and applications. Our study adds to growing evidence that filters to faunal recolonisation may be widespread in restored areas, with important implications for restoration practices. Firstly, examining individual species may more effectively identify filters than examining community successional patterns. Secondly, filters can persist over long time frames, possibly centuries, so management, such as the provision and accelerated development of CWD, may need to occur over similar time frames. Lastly, filters can be dynamic and repeated management interventions, such as thinning, may be required to overcome these filters. The growing evidence for filters suggests that facilitating faunal recolonisation is more complex than simply returning vegetation to restoration sites.","","see folder ""SE2 Craig et al studies functional trait information""","Susan Emerson","s.emerson@nhm.ac.uk","Susan Emerson",1,30,840,28

Sacred forests, i.e. natural areas protected by local people for cultural or reli- gious regions, may be keystone structures for forest birds in the Greater Himalayas, but there is limited understanding of their use by bird communities. We surveyed birds and their habitat in and adjacent to six Tibetan sacred forests in northwest Yunnan China, a biodiversity hotspot. Our goal was to understand the ecological and conservation role of these remnant forest patches for forest birds. We found that sacred forests supported a different bird community than the surrounding matrix, and had higher bird species richness at plot, patch, and landscape scales. While we encountered a homogeneous matrix bird community outside the scared forests, the sacred forests themselves exhibited high heterogeneity, and supported at least two distinct bird communities. While bird community composition was primarily driven by the vegetation vertical structure, plots with the largest-diameter trees and native bamboo groves had the highest bird diversity, indicating that protecting forest ecosystems with old-growth characteristics is important for Himalayan forest birds. Finally, we found an increased bird use of the sacred forests and their edges during 2010, a severe drought year in Yunnan, indicating that sacred forests may serve as refuges during extreme weather years. Our results strongly indicate that sacred forests represent an important opportunity for Himalayan bird conservation because they protect a variety of habitat niches and increase bird diversity at multiple spatial scales.","","","Susan Emerson","s.emerson@nhm.ac.uk","Susan Emerson",1,124,10168,82

We evaluated the potential role of scattered, remnant trees in enhancing ant diversity in agricultural lands within a biodiversity hotspot, namely the Cerrado savan- nas of central Brazil. Ant collections were performed in, beneath, and away from the crowns of a native tree species growing in planted pastures, soy fields, and in small (<400 ha) savanna reserves. Significantly more ant species were found beneath than 30 m away from scattered trees. The magnitude of this effect was similar in soy fields and in pastures at all scales of our analyses, except at the landscape scale where the effect was comparatively greater in soy fields. Most of the species that occurred more frequently beneath than away from trees nest on ground, indicating that the conservation value of scattered trees goes beyond the mere protection of arboreal ant species. Soy plantations presented a particular species-poor ground-dwelling fauna when compared with savannas, whereas differences in the number and composition of arboreal species were less marked. In contrast, the diversity of arboreal- and ground-dwelling ants recorded in and beneath pasture trees was nearly as high as the one found in savannas. It is suggested that pasture trees can have an important value for ant conservation off reserves, particularly in regions where most of the native vegetation has already been cleared.","","","Susan Emerson","s.emerson@nhm.ac.uk","Susan Emerson",3,27,2484,276

Study Design: Longitudinal study. Place and Duration of Study: Four forests; - Kion/Zaraninge, Kwamsisi/Kwahatibu, Msumbugwe and Gendagenda in PanganiSaadani ecosystem, from October 2010 to January 2011. Methodology: Eight permanent transects, each 500 m long stratified into forest core and forest edge habitats were used in each forest to identify types and quantify levels of human-induced disturbances, determine bird species composition, diversity and richness, and abundance. Therefore three circular plots, each 20 m radius were allocated at beginning, middle and end of each transect. The level of disturbance was assessed using four disturbance indicators; tree lopping, human trails, Pit-sawing and animal snaring while bird species were identified by sight and call. One-way Analysis of Variance was used to test for differences in bird abundance between forests. Moreover, Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index (H) was calculated for each forest to assess species diversity and evenness, and Bray-Curtis Cluster analysis was used to determine similarity in bird species composition between the forests. Results: A total of 564 individuals composed of 88 bird species distributed in ten Orders were recorded. The level of Pit-sawing and lopping differed significantly between forests (P<.05) with Msumbugwe being more disturbed than the rest. Bird abundance differed significantly between the forests (P<.05) with the highest abundance occurring in Msumbugwe. As expected, species richness and diversity were greater in least disturbed forests-Kiono/Zaraninge and Kwamsisi/Kwahatibu than in the highly disturbed forest, but forest dependent species were not significantly different between the study forests. Apparently, only Pit-sawing was found to correlate with bird abundance (P<.01) whereas similarities in species composition were evident with Kion/Zaraninge and Gendagenda exhibiting much overlap. Conclusion: Increasing forest disturbances seems to negatively impact on distribution of birds thus challenging conservationists to devising sustainable forest management strategies in order to sustain bird diversity and abundances in these unique forests.","Coordinates given - Table 1","","Susan Emerson","s.emerson@nhm.ac.uk","Susan Emerson",1,32,2976,93

CWD is very slow to develop naturally so, to accelerate the return of CWD-dependent species to restored areas, CWD is commonly returned manually. However, few studies have tested the effectiveness of such a strategy. We investigated whether the provision of CVVD, heaped into 'habitat piles' of varying density (0.4-5.7 piles ha(-1)), was effective in accelerating recolonisation by reptiles, frogs and mammals into 3-year old restored bauxite mine-pits in south-western Western Australia. Both reptile and mammal communities, and the abundances of some individual species, differed significantly between unmined and restored forest but the provision of CWD had only a weak effect in accelerating recolonisation. Acritoscincus trilineatus abundance showed a weak positive relationship with habitat pile density and both Cryptoblepharus buchananii and Christinus mannoratus, species that are very rare in restoration, were recorded adjacent to habitat piles in two and one mine-pits respectively. The weak effects of CWD in accelerating recolonisation were likely due to the differences in vegetation between unmined and restored forest, resulting in restored forests being primarily inhabited by generalist species that did not require CWD, and the highest habitat pile densities being <=,6% of log densities in unmined forest, suggesting that CWD-dependent species perceived all mine-pits as having similarly low levels of CWD, compared to unmined forest. Our results suggest that the provision of CWD in restored areas is critical to accelerate recolonisation of CWD-dependent fauna, but this will require consideration of both CWD spatial connectivity and temporal continuity. Spatial connectivity would be best achieved through CWD densities that approximate those in reference ecosystems, whereas temporal continuity will be harder to achieve, particularly in systems where CWD is slow to develop, and will require the development of innovative techniques and long-term management. However, ensuring the spatial connectivity and temporal continuity of CWD in restored areas should greatly increase their biodiversity value. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The fre- quent coexistence of morphologically similar, and presumably ecologically equivalent, congeneric species may indicate that such equivalents do not exclude each other as predicted by the neutral theory of biodiversity.

reflects the needs of local communities. We describe a multidisciplinary survey developed

compromises and reactions to trials over many months. We have tried to make the text useful
to readers from diverse backgrounds given the multidisciplinary nature of the procedures
described. Our experiences show that what is obvious to one is novel to another.
This is not intended as a manual. We would rather it was viewed as a summary of lessons
learned. Our reluctance to being overly prescriptive arises from both the ongoing nature of the
work and the specific context in which our methods have been developed. Only some of the
benefits and possible pitfalls of the methods described can be assessed now.
It is difficult to know what to call our methods. The title Exploring biological diversity, environment
and local peoples perspectives in forest landscapes at least describes the aim of our approach
and Methods for a multidisciplinary landscape assessment describes the content. Some
already refer to our approach as participatory biodiversity surveys, certainly shorter and clearer.
However, whether the formal portion of our methods can be considered participatoryis
debatable. Certainly, biodiversity surveys fails to describe the breadth of information gathered:
this includes many aspects not traditionally considered biodiversity. Readers may form their
own opinions.
It is important at the start to distinguish two aspects of these methods: first, the questions we
are addressing and second, the specific methods we have chosen to tackle them. The first can be promoted with little reservation. More caveats are required in presenting our methods.
We have encouraged similar studies elsewhere to develop alternative approaches and we
look forward to a wider suite of tried and tested methods in the future.

We sampled spiders in six habitat types (desert parks, urban desert remnants, industrial, agricultural, xeric- and mesic-residential yards) and tested how habitat type and productivity affected spider diversity and abundance. As expected, agricultural fields and mesic yards were more productive than the other, xeric habitats. These more productive habitats were characterized by higher abundances but lower spider diversity and were dominated by Lycosidae (wolf spiders), followed by Linyphiidae (sheet-web weavers). The increase in wolf spider abundance was positively correlated with habitat productivity and negatively correlated with the abundance of other predatory arthropods that might compete with, or prey upon, wolf spiders. Temporal changes in productivity affected spider abundance. After an El-Ni (n) over tildeo winter (May 1998), spider abundance was five times higher than after an extremely dry winter (May 2000). The differences in spider abundance between agricultural fields and the four xeric habitats were profound in 2000 but moderate in 1998, suggesting an interaction between the effects of natural and anthropogenic factors on spider populations. Compared with xeric habitats, the El-Ni (n) over tildeo effect was less profound in agricultural sites, suggesting that human land modification mollifies seasonal effects. We suggest that habitat structure and productivity alteration may change community structure, as the urban or agricultural habitats favor one or a few preadapted taxa over many others. Incorporation of large fragments of natural habitats into future landscape planning in urban environments may be important for conservation of rich spider communities.","","","Sam Hill","samantha.hill@unep-wcmc.org","Sam Hill",1,26,572,22

Biodiversity conservation of grasslands in the face of transformation and global climate change will depend mainly on rangelands because of insufficient conservation areas in regions suited to agriculture. Transformed vegetation (pastures, crops and plantations) is not expected to conserve much biodiversity. This study examined the impact of land use on the plant diversity and community composition of the southern Drakensberg grasslands in South Africa, which are threatened with complete transformation to pastures, crops and plantations.
2. The main land uses in this high rainfall region are: ranching or dairy production under private tenure using indigenous grassland, pastures (Eragrostis curvula, kikuyu  and ryegrass) and maize; plantation forestry; communal tenure (maize and rangelands); and conservation.
3. Plant diversity and composition were assessed using Whittaker plots. Transformed cover types were depauperate in species and ranged from kikuyu (1·4 species m2) and ryegrass (2·9), to pine plantation (3·1), E. curvula pasture (3·1), commercial maize (3·2) and communal maize (7·8). With the exception of pine plantations, these communities supported mostly exotic (50 of 70 species) or ruderal indigenous species and made little contribution to plant species conservation. Abandoned communal cropland reverted to an indigenous grassland almost devoid of exotic species within c. 20 years.
4. It was predicted that frequently cultivated sites (maize and ryegrass) would support less diversity than long-lived pastures (kikuyu and E. curvula ). This was contradicted by the relatively high species diversity of communal maize fields, which was attributed to a lack of herbicides, and the depauperate communities of kikuyu and of E. curvula pasture, which were attributed, respectively, to a dense growth form and a severe mowing regime. 
5.Pine plantations harboured fourfold more indigenous species per plot (27) than other transformed types. Species were mostly shade-tolerant grassland relics that had persisted for 12 years since planting, and some forest colonizers. Indigenous species
were unlikely to be maintained because of aggressive invasion by the exotic Rubus cuneifolius and severe disturbance associated with tree harvest and replanting.
6. The richness of indigenous grasslands was expected to differ in response to grazing pressure but they differed only in composition. Grasslands were dominated by grasses, despite the richness of herbaceous species. The dominance ofThemeda triandrawasreduced under livestock grazing in favour of more grazing-tolerant species. Exotic specieswere inconspicuous except for the dicotyledonRichardia brasiliensis, a subdominantunder communal grazing.
7.Southern Drakensberg grasslands are probably now stocked with livestock six- to35-fold higher than during pre-settlement times. A grassland protected forc.50 yearssupported twofold greater richness (101 species plot  1) than grazed grasslands, suggesting that a 150-year history of increased mammalian grazing had already reduced plant diversity.
8. Synthesis and applications. Land acquisition is costly, thus conservation of plant diversity in the southern Drakensberg requires a policy that inhibits transformation of rangelands. This can be achieved by enhancing their economic viability without changing the vegetation composition. Their inherent value must be recognized, such as for water production. The viability of commercial ranches can be improved by increasing their size. Conservation efforts need to be focused on plant taxa that only occur on unprotected rangelands.","","","Sam Hill","samantha.hill@unep-wcmc.org","Sam Hill",1,22,4229,246

communities were calculated. The results indicated that species richness and
abundance of butterfly communities were low in the natural closed forest, higher
in the disturbed forest, highest in the forest edge, lower in the shrub habitat and
lowest in the agricultural lands. The indices of species richness, evenness and
diversity of butterfly communities were low in agricultural lands and natural
closed forest but highest in the forest edge and shrub habitats. The families
Satyridae and Amathusiidae have the greatest species richness and abundance in
the natural closed forest, with a reduction in their species richness and abundance
from the natural closed forest to the agricultural lands. Species composition of
butterfly communities was different among five different habitat types (40%), was
similar in habitats outside the forest (68%) and was similar in habitats inside the
forest (63%). Diversity and abundance of butterfly communities are not different
between the natural closed forest and the agriculture lands, but species composition
changed greatly between these habitat types. A positive correlation between
the size of species geographical distribution range and increasing habitat disturbance
was found. The most characteristic natural closed forest species have the
smallest geographical distribution range.","Data provided by author is unpublished. Paper describes sampling methodology and landscape.","","Sam Hill","samantha.hill@unep-wcmc.org","Sam Hill",1,5,1250,250

richness and composition was similar in the six habitat surveyed, while shrew species
abundance varied between habitats. Canopy height and cover, density of stems and trees

the advantages and disadvantages of these two methods of forest restoration, one of the
most suitable management practices to restore forest while preserving shrew biodiversity
could be to perform an alternation of native seedling plantation lines and fallows.","p.2045 Figure 1 map of study sitesp.2047-48 Table 1 habitat and sampling methodology","","Sam Hill","samantha.hill@unep-wcmc.org","Sam Hill",1,24,264,11

In the village of Nkolbibanda, 50 kilometers south of the Cameroon capital of Yaoundé, CIFOR research is providing a better understanding of the environmental needs and priorities of the communities living next to the Ottotomo Forest Reserve.
Covering an area of 2,950 hectares, the Reserve was gazetted by the French colonial government in 1930 and remains off-limits to human activities other than the occasional collecting of non-timber forest products.

The inhabitants of Nkolbibanda belong to the Ewondo ethnic group and are largely dependent upon agriculture for food and income. Their primary sources of food include shifting cultivation, some plantation crops such as cocoa and increasingly palm oil, traditional forest products and bush meats such as palm rats, porcupines and antelope.

At the time the reserve was gazetted, traditional territories were not taken into account, including those traditionally accessed by the people of Nkolbibanda. But in the past 15-20 years, the population in the area has grown considerably, putting considerable pressure on local natural resources and resulting in increasing levels of conflict between communities and the reserve management.

CIFOR has been playing a leading role in improving relations between local communities, local NGO's and forest administrators. The current Multidisciplinary Landscape Assessment (MLA) project, led by CIFOR researcher Marieke Sassen, aims to enhance this process.

""We hope the outcomes of this project will serve as a basis for improved dialogue between all stakeholders, and lead to better decisions about the management of the reserve and the surrounding area,"" Sassen said.

Using an approach developed in East Kalimantan, Indonesia, Sassen and her team of researchers undertook a survey in 2003 involving both conventional biodiversity surveys and an assessment of local people's needs and perceptions.

The MLA approach aims at enhancing the understanding between development practitioners, local policy makers and forest communities. It will also help improve policy decisions that affect the local population and enhance the long term sustainability of the forest and it's inhabitants.

Marieke and her team have used a variety of research methods to explore the importance people attach to their tropical rainforest landscape. Conducted with men and women, both young and old, these methods include different forms of meetings. For example, 'Community Meetings' help compile historical data such as land use and village history, while 'Exercise Meetings' provide a ""valuation"" of landscape elements and animal species and their uses. Other techniques include participatory Mapping Meetings and Field Surveys and require building high levels of collaboration and trust with participants.

Not surprisingly, the initial analysis of survey results has shown that the forest is the second most important landscape unit behind the village. This raises one of the most challenging aspects of CIFOR's research: how to help villagers find the right balance between improving their food production and their need to sustain forests as an important source of land and of products that can be harvested?

People are aware of forest functions. They know, for example, that trees ""protect"" the forest, how seed dispersal is necessary for tree regeneration and how certain animals play an important role in this. They also know which activities damage the forest; including many they practice themselves, like cutting down trees and burning. However, when it comes to their own activities, they feel they do not have a choice if they want to practice agriculture and sustain themselves. As one elder men said, ""That is just the way we are, we eat (something) until it is finished and then we just find something else"". Sassen says this demonstrates now people have their own ways of adapting to changing conditions.

They also blame outsiders for damage to the forest by cutting down trees illegally in the reserve and on their land, or by poaching game or using poison to catch fish. Marieke said many respondents spoke of this ""outsider"" issue, arguing that while they should not have to change their own traditional activities, certain activities by outsiders should be prohibited.

Driving the increasing level of unsustainable practices has been the dramatic rise in recent years of the price of goods associated with the cash economy. Basic essentials such as soap, petroleum, matches and children's schooling place an increasing burden on the villagers to find cash.

One of the major challenges is to develop sustainable practices within the forestry reserve. Paramount to this is ensuring constructive dialogue at all levels between stakeholders. CIFOR is assisting this by aligning the current and future needs of forest mangers and villagers, as well as assisting policy makers to work closely with stakeholders.

""We give as much information as possible to the community and provide explanations about how involvement in the research will benefit them in the long term. It is important to overcome any levels of mistrust. Sure, it's too early to give a definite thumbs up to the MLA project. But I think I can safely say CIFOR's work is improving relations between NGO's, forest managers and local villagers. I hope that by building on this and past CIFOR activities, we can influence future decisions about the management of the reserve."" MH

Palawan, Philippines
On Palawan island in the Philippines, an MLA approach was used in the context of the EU funded project 'Leveling the Playing Field. This project aims to help stakeholders in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines achieve natural resources management. Stakeholders have different interests, goals and views on how natural resources should be managed- especially the views of traditional communities may be harder to solicit.

The MLA approach was used to assess how a Batak community from Palawan uses and perceives its natural resources. As well as revealing their perceptions about the environment, MLA provided biodiversity information on the different types of landscapes and the condition of the forests. Information was also gathered on how the Batak think about the future of these landscapes and what role they would like to play in the management of the natural resources in their territory. Local communities views should be considered in the preparation of a management plan from the very beginning.","see ""Phillipines.zip"" folder""MLA_Palawan.pdf"" gives sampling methodology""MLA Palawan.mdb"" provides abundance data","tree data (height, diameter etc) provided in ""MLA Palawan.mdb""","Sam Hill","samantha.hill@unep-wcmc.org","Sam Hill",2,24,2616,218

and shrubs, covers 85% of the total area in Santa Cruz Province and 25% in Tierra del
Fuego Island. Most of the land in the Patagonian region has been influenced by domestic
livestock grazing for more than 100 years. This has led to a substantial modification of
the ecosystem and the original floristic patterns. Erosion and degradation processes have
occurred in several areas of Patagonia mainly due to an overestimation of the carrying
capacity of these rangelands.
In this chapter we review patterns of plant and insect diversity in relation to
environmental drivers and grazing impact in the steppe of Argentinian South Patagonia.
In Santa Cruz, results from 141 sites indicated significant interactions between grazing
and the abiotic environment (mainly water avalilability) on plant diversity. Thecomplexity of these interactions indicated the need for examining patterns of species
turnover at different spatial scales.
Analysis of the steppe vegetation patterns from 113 sites along Tierra del Fuego
Island demostrated differences related to geographical zones (North, Center, East and
South), dominant vegetation types (grasslands, peatlands or shrublands) and disturbance
impact (grazing, beavers or burned areas). Because insect diversity of Tierra del Fuego
steppes is poorly known, coleopterans were selected as potential indicators of
biodiversity using pitfalls traps in the same vegetation survey sites. We found significant
changes in ground-active beetle assemblages generated by grazing and livestock
activities, both in grassland, peatlands and shrublands. Therefore, this group of insects
could be useful indicators of biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management.","Unpublished data, 2013 paper for methodsStudy 1: Pp74-7 & data from author: ""Biodiversity and Ecological long-term plots in Southern Patagonia.xls""Study 2: Pp82-3 & data from author: ""Biodiversity ...

deforested dry eastern South Island, New Zealand, but little is known about how the change from herbaceous
to woody vegetation alters the indigenous biota. We predicted that development of secondary shrublands would
exclude few grassland-specialist plant species and increase indigenous plant species occupancy (the extent
to which indigenous species capable of living in dryland landscapes are present) at a landscape scale. We also
predicted that taller and denser indigenous plant canopies would facilitate indigenous but not exotic plant
species at multiple scales, for example by reducing exotic grass competition or through positive plantplant
interactions. We tested our predictions by sampling vegetation in 100-ha blocks representing a gradient from
grassland to mixed intermediate grassland and shrubland to shrubland vegetation at three sites in Central
Otago. We found indigenous plant species in shrubland were complementary to those in grassland (additional
to the existing set) within and across our study sites, which led to higher indigenous species occupancy in
this dryland landscape. Grassland vegetation did not support significant numbers of indigenous plant species
complementary to those in shrubland, and we found no evidence that secondary succession displaced indigenous
plant species. Shrubland had higher diversity of indigenous plant species than grassland at multiple scales (across
sites, within 100-ha blocks and within 144-m2 plots), and had higher indigenous dominance of composition
across sites, but not at smaller (within-block and within-plot) scales. Indigenous dominance of composition
within blocks and plots was related to dominance of the physical structure of plant communities by indigenous
woody plants or tussock grasses, rather than to development of secondary shrubland alone. Reduced densities
of indigenous plant species were related to higher frequencies of exotic grass only where indigenous structural
dominance was low, indicating that competitive exclusion of indigenous plants by exotic grasses may depend
on degradation of indigenous structural dominance. We conclude that secondary succession from structurallydepleted
grassland to mixed indigenousexotic shrubland is likely to assist the conservation of indigenous plant
species in this dryland landscape.","Appendix S2 - biodiversity data

Using a variety of indices, diversity was measured along a gradient of anthropogenically disturbed habitats. The gradient, in terms of increasing levels of disturbance, ranged from primary rain forest, abandoned cacao plantations, productive cacao plantations, to banana plantations. The primary forest and abandoned cacao plantations were situated in a reserve and the productive cacao plantations, and banana plantations were located on privately owned land within 35 km of the reserve in the Sarapiqui Valley of Costa Rica. To sample ground-foraging ants, we placed tuna baits along the ground in each habitat. Although tuna baits attract a generalist assemblage of ants that may be better able to adapt to more disturbed sites, diversity of this community was significantly reduced with increased disturbance. Ant diversity was not different for forest and abandoned cacao sites except in terms of evenness, with the forest having a more even distribution of species. Forest and abandoned cacao sites were significantly more diverse than both productive cacao and banana plantations. The latter two did not differ significantly from each other in terms of diversity, but there was considerable variability within each of these habitat types. The results of this study suggest that conservation of diversity may be possible in a ''mosaic'' of different land uses, but further studies, such as those addressing the importance of scale and nearby source populations, are necessary before management practices can be implemented.","","","Tim Newbold","tim.newbold@unep-wcmc.org","Tim Newbold",1,11,1199,109

insectivores were found in logged forest. Supporting evidence that these differences could be attributed to logging was
obtained from correlations of bird abundances with measures of forest structure or composition. Changes in forest structure
are probably particularly important for sallying insectivores; these species will be one of the groups most at risk from

Overall, species richness seemed highest in the disturbed site, but both abundance and diversity of endemic butterflies were significantly higher in the natural forest. Although the butterfly assemblage showed a clear vertical structure in the natural forest, vertical stratification was no longer pronounced at the disturbed site. Comparative studies based on diversity estimates from ground samples should consider not only the scale at which sampling is carried out and influences from nearby habitat patches in the surrounding landscape mosaic, but also possible behavioural changes in stratified species after forest modification.

We investigated the effects of various forest uses on small mammal communities, in Sarawak, Malaysia, by comparing 20 study plots in six forest types: fragmented primeval forest, abandoned fallow at three developmental stages (new, young, and old), rubber plantation, and primary forest. An analysis of forest microhabitat structure revealed three distinctive groups: primary forest, new fallow, and other forests. These were characterized by canopy openness, the basal area, density, and species richness of trees, and vegetation types within a 600-m radius of each plot. In total, 283 individuals of small mammals from 22 species were captured. Small mammals in new fallow formed a distinctive group in an analysis of species composition, with high emergence of human-associated rats and arboreal treeshrews. However, small mammal communities in the other five forest types did not differ considerably. Rubber plantation patches affected the populations of a rodent and a treeshrew. Our results suggest that the various forest uses studied here, except for new fallow, do not have severe effects on small mammal communities. However, the invasion of human-associated species into primary forest may cause unfavorable or unexpected consequences, such as negative effects on natural forest and animal diversity.

Checked habitat patch size.  Added blocks.","over the past few decades, the montane forests of Peninsula Malaysia have been severely impacted by the cultivation of exotic crops and urban sprawl. To guide conservation initiatives, montane bird communities were studied to determine their response along a disturbance gradient with the aim of identifying key factors influencing their distribution. Habitat types surveyed included primary and secondary montane forests, a tea plantation, rural, and urban areas in Cameron Highlands and Fraser's Hill. Response variables included species richness and density quantified via point counts and mistnet surveys. Explanatory variables measured were related to vegetation structure, food abundance and land-use cover. Estimated 'true' species richness was higher for pristine and minimally disturbed sites, lower in tea plantation and lowest in heavily developed town centres. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling revealed that both vegetation structure (e.g. canopy density) and land-use cover (e.g. proportion of forest cover) influence species distribution; certain invasive lowland birds were tolerant of extreme development and native montane birds, in general, endured only slight habitat disturbances. A simulation indicated that montane forest dependant species richness started to decline when more than 20% of the canopy cover was lost. Less than a third of the species richness remained when more than 40% of the canopy cover was cleared. The logistic regression model suggested that sensitive species nested lower, were restricted to montane habitats and foraged in mid or high canopy. The dominance of lowland invasives in highly developed urban sites reveals that homogenisation of bird communities can occur even at higher altitudes (> 1400 in a.s.l.). The results indicated that native montane birds communities are sensitive to habitat loss and degradation. Thus, any development in the highlands must proceed with minimal disturbance to montane forests, of which, keeping the canopy cover intact should be a crucial consideration. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Ecological indicators are needed to warrant the efficiency of the protection measures, particularly in the mosaic landscapes Of the peripheral areas. Two insect families (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae (Cetoniinae) and Lepj.doptera: Nymphalidae) were trapped along transects crossing landuse units submitted to various human pressures (none, hunting, traditional and intensive crops, grazing) in two countries (Burkina Faso and Benin). Plant species richness was found to be correlated with the abundance of four fruit-feeding insect species and with the fruit-feeding butterflies species richness, but not with the Cetoniinae species richness. The abundance of Nymphalidae species generally dropped with human activities, but that of Cetoniinae species followed the intermediate disturbance theory.

We compared bat richness, abundance and diversity, and found that none of these variables was different among stages or rainy seasons. However, of the 10 most common bat species, two were significantly more abundant in stands at the early stages of secondary succession, while the opposite was true for three other species. Canopy cover mainly explains these patterns. Rainy season had no effect on the abundance of the common species. The results of this study indicate that although some frugivorous species were very abundant in the younger stands, the majority of the rare species were captured in older stands. The absence of rare and habitat-specialized species from young successional stages close to primary forest suggests that, for effective bat conservation in landscapes modified by human activity, areas with original vegetation should be maintained to ensure the survivorship of sensitive-to-deforestation species.","p220 Figure 1 map of study site

forest landscapes. Yet there is little information available concerning the consequences of different forestry
options for biodiversity conservation in the tropics. We sampled the leaf-litter herpetofauna of primary, secondary,
and Eucalyptus plantation forests in the Jari River area of northeastern Brazilian Amazonia. We used
four complementary sampling techniques, combined samples from 2 consecutive years, and collected 1739
leaf-litter amphibians (23 species) and 1937 lizards (30 species). We analyzed the data for differences among
forest types regarding patterns of alpha and beta diversity, species-abundance distributions, and community
structure. Primary rainforest harbored significantly more species, but supported a similar abundance of amphibians
and lizards compared with adjacent areas of second-growth forest or plantations. Plantation forests
were dominated by wide-ranging habitat generalists. Secondary forest faunas contained a number of species
characteristic of primary forest habitat. Amphibian communities in secondary forests and Eucalyptus plantations
formed a nested subset of primary forest species, whereas the species composition of the lizard community
in plantations was distinct, and was dominated by open-area species. Although plantation forests are relatively
impoverished, naturally regenerating forests can help mitigate some negative effects of deforestation for herpetofauna.
Nevertheless, secondary forest does not provide a substitute for primary forest, and in the absence
of further evidence from older successional stands, we caution against the optimistic claim that natural forest
regeneration in abandoned lands will provide refuge for the many species that are currently threatened by
deforestation.","","","Tim Newbold","tim.newbold@unep-wcmc.org","Tim Newbold",1,3,159,53

We present a baseline analysis of the effects of habitat modification on birds in a lower montane forest landscape in Ecuador, comparing avian community composition in landscape elements subjected to different levels of human modification: primary forest, secondary forest, edge habitat and agricultural land. We use data from a point count survey of 300 counts at 150 sites to test whether community composition and density of birds with different reported habitat preferences and foraging strategies change among landscape elements. Species richness and diversity were lowest in agricultural land, but on some measures, equally low in primary forest. Richness and diversity peaked in secondary forest and edge habitat, but ordination and density analysis revealed clear differences in their species composition. While secondary forest contained mostly forest-preferring species, edge habitat harboured a mix of forest and open-land birds. There was a clearly structured gradient in species composition across landscape elements, with densities of habitat specialists, foraging guilds and families varying considerably from primary forest to agricultural land. Agricultural land was characterised by an assemblage of widespread, abundant species very different from that in core forest habitats. As such, while the majority of montane forest birds appear resilient to a certain level of habitat modification, they cannot persist, and are displaced, where forest has been cleared outright. We argue that, for Andean montane forests, preservation of mature secondary forest offers flexibility in supplementing preserved primary forest areas to provide sufficient habitat for the persistence of this incredibly diverse but severely threatened bird community..","","","Tim Newbold","tim.newbold@unep-wcmc.org","Tim Newbold",1,150,31650,211

This prediction was examined for the herpetofauna in Quintana Roo, Mexico. Quantitative sampling (108 transects) of reptiles was undertaken monthly (January-September 2004) along a vegetation gradient covering induced grasslands, and regrowth and primary rain forests. A total of 35 species was found, 14 being present in and five showing dependence on mature forests. Lizards contributed > 90 per cent of the individuals observed. Reptile abundance and snake species richness was highest in primary forests, even though the lower abundance and richness did not differ between regrowth forest and induced grasslands. Multivariate ordinations and ANOSIM tests displayed clear differences in assemblage structure among vegetation types, mainly caused by contrasting abundances of lizard species having distinctive arboreal or terrestrial habits. There was no evidence that snake assemblages differed between secondary forests and induced grasslands. Microhabitat availability had a key role in shaping species composition through the vegetation gradient. Our results dismiss the hypothesis that secondary forests can act as reservoirs of primary forest reptile diversity on the basis that many taxa depend largely on habitat quality and have specialized life-history traits, and that biological succession does not guarantee the recovery of assemblage complexity.","p749 Figure 1 map of study site

We tested this hypothesis for aquatic insect communities in tank-forming bromeliads in forested and non-forested habitats in Costa Rica. Bromeliad tanks hold much of the standing water in this region and therefore provide an important resource for insects with aquatic larval stages. We quantified the relative importance of land-use type and the bromeliad-specific ""local"" environment on the insect community, and also the effect of land-use type on this local environment. Insect species responded to both land-use type and the local environment, with these variables explaining a total of 36% of species densities. The local environment independently explained 19% of insect densities, while land-use type explained 17%, mainly through its modification of the local environment. Local environmental conditions were strongly correlated to land-use type (r(2) = 0.64), with non-forest habitat having a higher average temperature, a greater variation in temperature, and a lower density of bromeliads. Our results indicate that the land-use type in which bromeliads occur influences the relative densities of insects by altering the local environment of bromeliads. Therefore, maintaining bromeliads under land-use conversion will not necessarily maintain the bromeliad insect community of the original forested habitat.","p.163 Table 1 abundance data","","Tim Newbold","tim.newbold@unep-wcmc.org","Tim Newbold",1,4,56,14

Little is known about the effects of these anthropogenic changes on bat fauna or feeding behaviour. To better explore anthropogenic effects on bats (Chiroptera), we investigated the diversity and feeding habits of bats in an intact lowland dipterocarp forest and surrounding areas of varying vegetation types. The total sampling effort using mist nets (32,795 m(2)h) resulted in the capture of 495 bats, representing 28 species. Simpson's index of diversity was relatively high in primary forests (7.86) compared to secondary forests (3.38), orchards (3.65), and oil palm plantations (1.24). The capture rate of two frugivorous bats clearly differed among the four vegetation types, and these species were never caught in orchards or oil palm plantations. In addition, the capture rate of microchiropterans was notably lower in oil palm plantations than in the other three vegetation types. These results indicate that many bat species rarely use agricultural land for feeding, and these plant communities are not suitable for maintaining bat diversity. However, the data on the feeding habits of three megachiropterans that were frequently captured in orchards and oil palm plantations indicate that agricultural plants are their primary food sources. Orchards and oil palm plantations may be inadequate habitats for most frugivorous and insectivorous bats, but these plant communities may provide important food sources for certain species of megachiropterans.","p215 Figure 1 map of study site

Although drastic modification of the habitat has been shown to negatively affect amphibians, we are far from a complete understanding of the response of amphibian communities to deforestation. We studied frog assemblages in a gradient of forest modification in a humid area of Costa Rica, where the primary forest has been partially converted into pasture. The study area is a mosaic of primary palm forest, abandoned pasture covered by secondary forest, and pasture. Species richness was assessed by randomized walk surveys and audio strip transects. We also measured ecological features to evaluate the relationship between landscape alteration and amphibian distribution. The study area hosted a large number of amphibian species. We focused our monitoring on six anurans: Leptodactylus labialis, Eleutherodactylus fitzingeri, E. diastema, Hyla rosenbergi, H. microcephala, and Cochranella granulosa. Three species (L. labialis, H. rosenbergi, and H. microcephala) were most abundant in pasture areas with livestock presence, while E. fitzingeri, E. diastema, and C. granulosa were associated with primary forest. Most of the variation in community structure was explained by the joint effect of forest alteration and presence of livestock. Whereas forest specialists suffer direct negative effect from deforestation, generalist species can take advantage of forest alteration and the presence of farm animals. Species that are able to take advantage of the new environmental characteristics associated with human modifications of landscapes will come to prevail in the new communities.","coordinates and abundance data within zipped folder ""Furlani""","","Tim Newbold","tim.newbold@unep-wcmc.org","Sam Hill",1,14,84,6

on the abundance and the raid rates of two species of swarm-raiding army ants, which
are considered keystone organisms of tropical rainforests. The abundance of army ants
was measured by transect monitoring and by short-term pitfall trapping while raid rates
were measured by long-term pitfall trapping over a period of five months. Dorylus wilverthi
was the most abundant army ant in undisturbed rainforest and its abundance and raid rate
strongly declined in small forest fragments. In contrast, the abundance of Dorylus molestus
increased with decreasing fragment size and compensated for the decline of D. wilverthi in
terms of abundance and ecological functionality (i.e. raiding rates). D. molestus appears to
have a higher ability of using the agricultural land surrounding the Kakamega Forest than
D. wilverthi, which may explain the species-specific differences in the susceptibility to habitat
fragmentation. Our study demonstrates that habitat fragmentation may have a differential
effect on two ecologically highly similar keystone species. Moreover, it shows that
species compensation might help in maintaining an important ecosystem function (i.e.
raiding by swarm-raiding army ants) in fragmented tropical rainforests.","Methods section for description of sampling technique, raw abundance data and coordinates provided by author in file (""army_ants_2013_PREDICTS_1""), site descriptions provided in emails.","","Tim Newbold","tim.newbold@unep-wcmc.org","Tim Newbold",1,16,32,2

A long history of grazing by ponies in the New Forest landscape has created a diverse mosaic of habitats that are of international significance. We investigated patterns of species diversity and composition across the New Forest landscape by sampling soil, leaf litter and ground macrofauna from woodland, grassland and heathland plots across the entire landscape. We used a spatially replicated design of hand sorted soil pits, Winkler extraction of leaf litter, and pitfall traps. We concentrated on diversity patterns of the following target groups: Coleoptera, Formicidae, Isopoda, Chilopoda, Diplopoda, Opiliones and Lumbricidae. The most striking difference in species assemblages is between wooded and open areas. Woodlands are the most diverse habitats and have a distinct assemblage, largely due to those leaf litter invertebrate species which are only present under a closed canopy. Open areas are less diverse, with diversity particularly low in the wet grasslands. However, the open areas do have a distinct fauna, especially in the wet and dry heaths which are home to a number of rare species, particularly of Formicidae. We discuss the potential conservation problems facing the New Forest and how these might affect soil macrofauna biodiversity in the future and conclude that climate change; over-grazing; and land use changes represent the largest threats. Although a relatively stable landscape which benefits from protection under UK law, changes in grazing intensity or management practices in the New Forest, particularly for some of the habitats of European importance (e.g. wet heathlands), could negatively affect soil macrofauna biodiversity. Climate change may also exacerbate biodiversity decline as a result of increased grazing intensity or changes in management.","","","Victoria Burton","v.burton@nhm.ac.uk","Victoria Burton",8,113,3246,227

Sites close to industrial areas were compared with areas considered to be pristine. The broad objective of the study was to identify changes in the chemistry of a suite of lichens that could be caused by pollutants from the industrial sites. In particular, increases in the ratios of K:Mg and K:Ca + Mg are indicators of acid deposition and increased N indicates increased N deposition. Lead was also measured in lichens. Other elements measured were Ba, Ca, Cd, Cu, K, Mg, Na, Ni, Pb, Sr and Zn in top-soils. The Pechora basin, north-eastern European Russia, includes the north and east of the Komi Republic and a major portion of the Nenets Autonomous region. It is bounded by the Ural mountains to the east and by the Timan range to the west. The area has extensive natural resources, both renewable (e.g. forests) and non-renewable (e.g. minerals, coal, oil and gas). There were limited modifications in the chemistry of lichens and top-soils and lichen diversity close to an oil and gas industrial complex. Here, there were elevations of lead and nitrogen concentrations in lichen apices and in the apical:basal nitrogen ratio in Flavocetraria cucullata, with lower lichen diversity in epigeal and epiphytic lichens. Elevated concentrations of Ba and Ca were found in soil-ash over the 0-5 cm horizon, probably as a result of local emissions from construction activity and gas flaring, rather than from long-range transport. Virtually all other sites remained unmodified and reflected background concentrations. The ecological impacts of the measured pollution loads were low, as elemental concentrations were generally below detection limits, except for one industrial site, where there were signs of an early indicator of industrial activity.

We collected spiders in pitfall traps 2 years after the application of partial-cutting treatments ill deciduous stands at EMEND and 6 years after similar treatments in deciduous stands at SAFE. Although we are aware of the challenges imposed by disparate locations and whole-scale experimental methods. our objective was to compare the effects of partial cutting oil spider assemblages (diversity and community composition), and ill doing SO, to formulate a few general Statements. Overall, 98 species (6107 individuals) were collected from Alberta and 86 species (3414 individuals) from Quebec. Of these, 44 species were common to both regions. Ordination and indicator-species analyses revealed a distinct effect of geographic separation: the spider assemblages in deciduous stands within the boreal plains ecoregion of Alberta and the boreal shield ill Quebec were distinct. However, the effects of partial cutting oil spider assemblages within each project were similar: removal of 25%-33% of trees shifted a characteristic old-growth fauna toward one more typical of clearcuts. Indicator-species analysis also revealed the dominance of wolf spider (Lycosidae) species in clearcuts Within both experiments and we present evidence that clear-Cutting homogenizes spider assemblages. Old-growth forests contain spider faunas that are easily disrupted by moderate partial Cutting. In the face of: intense harvesting practices, managing for the maintenance of biodiversity and conservation of spider faunas in northern forests will require retention of old-growth forests.","","","Victoria Kemp","victoria.kemp12@imperial.ac.uk","Victoria Kemp",1,120,10560,88

We assessed relatively long-term effects of clear-cutting on litter dwelling land snails, a group with slow active dispersal and considered to be intolerant to microclimate changes. In a pair wise design we compared snail abundance, species density, and species composition between 13 old seminatural stream-side stands and 13 matched young stands developed 40-60 years after clear-cutting. Using a standardized semi-quantitative method, we identified all snail specimens in a 1.5 l subsample of a pooled litter sample collected from small patches within a 20 x 5 m plot in each stream-side stand. From the young stands a mean of 135 shells and 9.5 species was extracted which was significantly higher than the 58.1 shells and 6.9 species found in old forests. Only two of the 16 species encountered showed a stronger affinity to old than to young forests. In short-term studies of boreal stream-side forests land snail abundance is reduced by clear-cutting. Our results indicate that this decline is transient for most species and within a few decades replaced by an increase. We suggest that local survival in moist stream-side refugia makes the land snails able to benefit from the higher pH and more abundant non-conifer litter in young than in old boreal forests. Our results highlight the importance of longer term studies as a basis for management guidelines for biodiversity conservation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Our results show that fertilized stands had 38% more species and 21% more individuals than unfertilized stands. Compared with stands under traditional management, the further intensification of forestry by repeated applications of fertilizers thus seemed to enhance species richness and abundance of forest birds. We cannot conclude at this stage whether the response in the bird community was caused by changes in food resources or increased structural complexity in the forest canopy due to the skid roads used for the application of the fertilizers.

We examined the spatial distribution of meadow jumping mice (Zapus hudsonius) captured in 3 upland habitat types (forest interior, forest edge, and logged forest) in the boreal forest of southeastern Yukon, Canada. Meadow jumping mice were the third most common rodent captured, and consistently constituted 19.7% of captures in all of the habitat types. Meadow jumping mice may not be rare in some boreal mammal assemblages. Significantly less animals were captured in the forest interior compared to the forest edge or logged forest (P < 0.05). A preference or avoidance of sharp habitat edges created by logging was not detected. Logged areas may be more preferred over unlogged areas by meadow jumping mice because they provide relatively diverse and abundant food resources and cover. To provide data more useful for biodiversity conservation, we suggest that studies of small mammals in forest ecosystems deploy a variety of trap types and sample at sufficient intensity to provide information on both dominant and rare species.

We used old-growth irregular stands as references in comparing the impact of these silvicultural treatments on the diversity and abundance of beetles. Three groups were targeted: saproxylic flying beetles, epigaeic saproxylic beetles and epigaeic non-saproxylic beetles. A sampling design including 320 pitfall traps and 80 multidirectional flight-interception traps was deployed in 2007. A total of 26 906 beetles was captured including 407 taxa distributed among 52 families. We found that clearcutting with protection of the advanced growth and soils and irregular shelterwood cutting leaving small merchantable stems had a greater impact on beetle communities than both selection cuttings. Canopy opening as well as the presence of snags and downed woody debris appear as important attributes for several saproxylic and non-saproxylic species. Beetle communities in selection cuttings remained more similar to those found in controls; these silvicultural treatments are new tools to implement ecosystemic and sustainable management in irregular boreal forests.","","","Victoria Kemp","victoria.kemp12@imperial.ac.uk","Victoria Kemp",2,160,41920,524

As with other approaches to coarse filter conservation, partial cutting is hypothesized to maintain and potentially recreate plant and animal assemblages consistent with a range of natural variability. In this study, we used ground-dwelling spiders (Araneae) to evaluate whether partial cutting and a cohort model of ecosystem management are sufficient to preserve biodiversity found in mature and over-mature boreal black spruce stands prone to paludification. We compared the spider fauna (11,628 individuals representing 136 species) in replicated partial cuts, clear cuts and uncut control stands with a chronosequence of mature and over-mature naturally regenerated stands (94-288 years since the last fire) (25 stands in total] in the same region of the northern Clay belt in Quebec (Canada). In stands that were old-growth prior to cutting, harvesting had strong repercussions on spider assemblages that were not attenuated by less intensive, partial cutting. The most obvious changes in spider assemblages were related to increased recruitment of species that were nearly absent in uncut stands. Several cosmopolitan species that were widely distributed among stands prior to harvest increased in cut stands. Spider assemblages collected following either cutting methods were not consistent with assemblages found within the chronosequence and thus fell outside the observed range of natural variability. However we did not observe a similar recruitment effect for spider species in younger stands with relatively higher levels of retention. We demonstrate that the interaction between stand age prior to cutting, the degree of paludification as well as remnant basal area are important considerations when evaluating the efficacy of partial cutting to maintain forest spider assemblages and biodiversity at large in black-spruce stands. ""We also suggest that retention levels in partial cuts will have to be substantially increased to maintain spider communities within their range of natural variation in managed forested landscapes."" However partial cutting with higher levels of retention, particularly in younger stands, may be useful in coarse filter management particularly for establishing or accelerating spider assemblages towards those found in old-growth stands","Map of Study Area Fig 1. page 2081

We asked whether time-lagged responses or recovery processes had dominated the period between two re-inventories, 2.5 and 10.5 years after logging, focusing both on the whole community and on species of conservation concern.

Even if the buffer strips displayed more time-lagged colonizations and local extinctions over the later period compared to the clear-cuts, the overall species composition in the buffer strips was still significantly more similar to the prelogging conditions than the clear-cuts. The red-listed species had mostly declined during the first period, and the number of red-list species per plot (mostly species growing on dead wood) was rather stable at <20% of predisturbance levels in clear-cuts and <60% in buffer strips in the last re-inventory. Synthesis and applications. We show that most extinctions of red-list species occurred soon after disturbance and that the conclusions drawn from a study carried out 2.5 years after the disturbance did not change profoundly 8 years later. Although the species composition in the buffer strips continued to change over time, sensitive species survived much better in buffer strips than in clear-cuts, which supports the practice of retaining buffer strips for terrestrial species too. This knowledge should encourage managers to find ways of increasing the efficacy of this practice. One obvious measure could be to retain wider strips or implement other management practices that make the buffer strips less sensitive to wind, which will lead to higher tree retention to support a prelogging species composition.","","","Victoria Kemp","victoria.kemp12@imperial.ac.uk","Victoria Kemp",1,35,9345,267

To investigate the effects of differentially contrasting edges (low vs. intermediate vs. high) on carabid beetle assemblages in urban boreal forests, we placed pitfall traps along a gradient from 6 m into three matrix types (secondary forest vs. grassland vs. asphalt) up to 60 m into urban forest patches in the cities of Vantaa and Helsinki, southern Finland. Individual species and carabid beetle assemblages were strongly affected by edge contrasts and distance from the forest edge. The strongest effect on individual species was caused by
high contrasting edges: generalist and open-habitat species were favoured or not affected while forest specialists were affected negatively. Effects of the abundances of potential prey and competitors on the carabid beetles were also evaluated. Forest and moisture-associated carabid species were negatively to neutrally associated with springtail abundances while generalist and open habitat, and dryness associated species were more positively related to springtail abundances (a potential food source). In terms of potential competitors, forest and moisture-associated carabid species were negatively and/or neutrally affected by ant and wood ant numbers, while generalist and open-habitat species were neutrally to positively associated with these taxa. It appears that carabid beetle habitat associations are more important in the responses of these beetles across edges of different
contrast than are the prey and competitor numbers collected there. We recommend the creation of soft or low-contrast
urban edges if the aim of urban management is to protect forest carabids in cities.","Page 4/15: Table 1 Means, standard errors of means, and minimum and maximum abundance values of the ground beetle species collected in Helsinki and Vantaa (no sites = 12; 4 replicates of 3 treatment types)","","Victoria Kemp","victoria.kemp12@imperial.ac.uk","Victoria Kemp",1,96,4032,42

We evaluated the effectiveness of green-tree retention for conserving mature forest-associated, generalist, and early-successional songbirds in aspen stands that were 1-15 years post-harvest. We compared species occupancy estimates at sites where green-tree retention levels were exceeded (>10% canopy cover), met (3-10%), or below (<3%) recommended retention guidelines. We also compared the relative importance of these levels of green-tree retention to forest stand age in explaining songbird occurrence. With the exception of Red-eyed Vireos, our results suggest that current green-tree retention guidelines are ineffective at increasing site occupancy of mature forest-associated songbirds in aspen harvest units. Additionally, site occupancy of early-successional and generalist songbirds were unaffected by these levels of retention. Rather, site occupancy probabilities for most forest birds showed a clear association with age since harvest (1-15 years); however, the strength and direction of the association varied by species. Our research highlights the importance of considering forest stand age when assessing the impact of silvicultural prescriptions on forest songbirds. Future management objectives in aspen forests should reflect the value of clearcutting to early-successional and generalist bird species, while recognizing that green-tree retention as measured in our study does little to promote occupancy of the mature forest-associated bird community.

The community consists of 19 species belonging to eight genera. Harpalus is the dominant genus and ranks the first in abundance. As a whole, the carabid fauna in this area is simple, having relatively few species and genera. The dominant species are Harpalus simplicidens, H. griseus and H. tridens. Considering the monthly fluctuation of carabid abundance, it reaches a maximum in September, and falls to a minimum in October. The fluctuation of carabids differs among different cropplanting patterns, and is affected to an extent by the changes of the landscape and agricultural activities. Field margins are shelters for carabids where they tend to gather, and these margins play a pivotal role in protecting the carabids. Carabid density in field margins is higher than that in adjacent farmlands, and the monthly fluctuation range there is also narrower.","Hebei Province","","Yuan Pan","yp509@ic.ac.uk","Yuan Pan",1,30,570,19

sustainability of ecosystems. The environmental effects of plantations comprised of
fast-growing introduced trees have been vigorously debated. On one hand, monocultures
have been said to exhaust resources, resulting in decreased biodiversity. Conversely, it has
been stated that monocultures may favor regeneration of undergrowth plants from surrounding
forests, increasing biodiversity. In order to clarify the effects of planting Eucalyptus
trees on species composition, diversity, and functional type of understory vegetation
in Yunnan province, a field trial was implemented to compare Eucalyptus plantations (EPs)
with two other local current vegetation types (secondary evergreen forests (SEs), and
abandoned farmlands (AFs)). Each vegetation type was sampled in each of three elevational
ranges (low = 1,0001,400 meters above sea level (masl), medium = 1,4001,800
masl, and high = 1,8002,200 masl). Sample sites within each elevational range had
similar environmental characteristics (slope, aspect, etc.). Thus, we sampled three vegetation
types at each of three sites at each of three elevations for a total of 27 plots. We
calculated relative abundance and importance value of species and diversity indexes to
evaluate differences among local current vegetation types and elevational ranges,
employing multivariate ordination analyses and other methods such as Analyses of Variance
(ANOVA) and Indicator Species Analysis. We found that fast growing introduced
Eucalyptus plantations led to reduced plant diversity in the study area, and that rare or threatened species were recorded almost exclusively in the SE plots, being essentially
absent from the EP and AF plots. The understory plant diversity did not correlate with the
altitude gradient significantly. Eucalyptus plantations (EPs) have a simpler community
structure than that of either secondary evergreen forests (SEs; similar to natural state) or
abandoned farmlands (AFs). No variable significantly explained variation of the understory
shrub layer, but soil moisture-holding capacity and overstory coverage were significant in
explaining variation of the understory herb layer, suggesting that the study of soil physical
properties is necessary for better understanding of their importance in Eucalyptus plantations
and other local current vegetation types.","Lancang, Menglian, and Ximeng counties of Puer, Yunnan Province, China","","Yuan Pan","yp509@ic.ac.uk","Yuan Pan",1,27,3888,144

woodland, grassland, and intensively cultivated
fields at Chongli County in Northern China. An array of
eight pitfall traps per plot was used to sample the beetles

conifer woodland and semi-natural grassland harbored
very similar beetle assemblages. These had significantly
lower rarefied species numbers than the distinctly different
assemblages recorded in cultivated fields, with differences
in alpha diversity being less pronounced for large
and predatory species. Carabid activity-density levels were
higher in both woodland and grassland than in fields, with
this trend being most pronounced for predatory and large
species. To conserve high levels of gamma diversity, it
is important to maintain a mosaic of agricultural areas
and semi-natural habitats. The latter also form a potential
source for predatory species important in pest control.
It appears that woodland-specific species are rare in the
study area, or they have not been able to reach and colonize

Globally, large areas of primary forest have
been replaced by secondary forests and plantations, and changes in tree species composition have often
led to alteration of plant and animal communities that were associated with those primary forests. Hong
Kong has experienced a long history of deforestation and may be one of the pioneers in using exotic tree
plantations for forest restoration in Asia. In this study, we sampled herpetofaunal assemblages in native,
secondary forests and exotic Lophostemon confertus plantations by transect surveys, pitfall traps, and coverboards.
Amphibians were more abundant in secondary forests than in plantations, while the abundance
of reptiles and species compositions of both amphibians and reptiles were similar in both forest types.
Body condition of the most common reptile, Sphenomorphus indicus (Indian forest skink), was similar
between secondary forests and plantations. However, higher proportions of S. indicus exhibited autotomized
or missing tails in secondary forests than in plantations, which may be related to higher percentages
of rock and wood cover on the forest floor potentially increasing the chance of escape from predators in
secondary forests. Secondary forests may provide a better habitat for herpetofauna, we suggest that
