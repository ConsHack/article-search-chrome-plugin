From aerial photos it appears as if at least some patches of trees appear to have been planted (lines of planting are visible).  Natural forest is oak - some images show oak forest whereas others show pine trees.  Therefore to be conservative have put as Secondary Mature (the images show a mature forest) with Minimal use intensity. Documents online refer to Stefanesti forest as a protected deciduous oak woodland so have entered as Primary Forest.  I cannot find any information on use intensity but as it is refered to as protected, have entered as 'minimal' use.  Same with Comana Forest.  Calugareni Forest is historical remnant but cannot find any information as to use intensity so have entered as Primary Forest with Cannot decide for use intensity. As above for Peris Forest.","The study was has sites in three habitat types: natural, semi-natural and urban.\n\nI interpreted these into PREDICTS terminology as:\nNatural: primary forest minimal use, well within fragment\nSemi-natural: pasture minimal use, part of a fragmented landscape. based on google earth images, i interpreted that all the sites took place in grassland areas next to plantation forests. i interpreted these as minimal use.\nUrban: urban light use. based on satelltie images i saw a fair amount of greenspace and a lot of suburbia -- even thought they describe it as 'highly' urbanised\n\nSC1 28/1/2014 Added Habitat patch size as they are given by the author (pag. 3345)\nSC1 28/1/2014 Changed Predominant habitat within the site from Primary forest to Mature Secondary vegetation, as indicated by the author.\nSH1 21/05/2014 Changed predominant habitat for sites 29 & 30 (Prophetston State Park) from Pasture to Young Secondary as website says is site of restored prairie grassland.  Also same for 27 & 28 as this is restored marshland (restoration began 1994). 24-26 (Purdue U. Hort Park) appears to be large area of mature woodland, unclear if primary or secondary, but is part of protected area so have changed former classification of 'Pasture' to Mature Secondary. Changed sites 16-23 from Pasture to Young secondary as, although they are located within farms, the actual sampling sites are around buildings, driveways, etc","I converted the common names given to scientific names as best I could through google.\n\nI determined the use intensity of each site with Urbanness @ r = 2500m (as 250m is probably too small an area for birds, plus the sampling site is often larger than this). Sites that had a value less than 1/3 of the max were minimal, sites that had a value less than 2/3 of the max were light, the rest were intense.\n\nFor two species (Cossypha caffra, Hirundo rustica) their names were replicated either due to my translating the names or due to duplication in the original dataset (for instance, is there a difference between a Barn Swallow and a Europena Swallow -- not according to wiki!). In this instance, I took the sum of these duplicated species.\n\n12/11/2013 LH1 Changed empty cells on site by species matrix to zeroes.\n21/11/2013 LH1 Replaced Dom's latin binomials with the common names suppplied by the authors. In the process, I noticed that Dom had incorrectly entered the site x species matrix - there were more sites on the Sites_study_1 tab than there filled columns in Abund_study_1. I reformatted the site x species matrix to correctly match the sites. There are therefore some empty columns in the site x species matrix. The author's datafile 'All_Data_Durescumming.xls' is not internally consistent. The 'site-spp matrix common tab' does not contain rows for sites 101,102,103,105 and 110 yet the tabs for each of these sites shows that species were found. This needs further investigation.\n21/11/2013 The name 'Cape Robin Chat' was duplicated. On looking at Appendix S3.doc (the list of species), it is clear that the first occurrence of 'Cape Robin Chat' should be 'Cape Longclaw'.\n21/11/2013 LH1 Added habitat descriptions.\n26/11/2013 SH1 As LH1 noticed inconsistencies between the data provided by the author and the spreadsheet, I have been back through the data provided by the author and have added data for 5 sites which were previously blank - sites 101,102,103,105 and 110.  Within the data for these sites were three species not recorded within any other sites, therefore I added three new species rows in the site by species matrix.  Note that neither the species nor the sites appear in the summarised data provided by the author in 'All_Data_Durescumming.xls' - the data is only contained in the tabs for each of the sites.  It appears that the summarised datafile was what was used for the paper as these species do not appear in the paper either.\n\nSH1 26/11/2013 Changed fragmentation layout from 'cannot decide' to 'part of remnant patch' for all sites.  Looked at blocking structure and is correct - there are no blocks of sampling.  Added linear extent value and checked habitat patch size and is correctly entered.\nSH1 28/05/14 Changed predominant habitat from Urban to Primary for all sites as samples were taken within remnant patches of primary.  Use intensity was assessed using Google Maps - areas with obvious footpaths, cleared patches etc were classified as Intense use, other areas were assessed as Light use.","Live traps were used to capture both reptiles and mammals -- I've separated the two regardless if they share the same sampling efforts. I'm not sure whether this is a good idea or not.\n\nI used google maps to ascertain the use intensity of each site. If the site was deep in a forest with a large distance between it and houses and roads, I set it to minimal. If it was near houses or near gardens in a smaller path, I set it to light. If it was in a small patch surrounded by houses I set it to intense.\n\nSH:  curation - changed Abundance metric type from 'abundance' to 'occurrence' 14.11.13\nSC1 29/1/2014 Added fragmentation layout\nSc1 29/1/2014 Merged the 2 studies togehter as methodology, location and date applied were the same for mammals and reptiles so they shouldn't have been separated\n\nSH1 28/05/14 Changed Predominant habitat from Urban to Primary Forest as paper states that areas sampled are remnants of natural vegetation.  Did not check use intensity as DB's definition sounds reasonable.","They followed the Globenet protocol. They worked on a forest of English oaks of over 100 years old. They split their 3 sampling habitats into rural, suburban and urban based on the percentage of land taken up by buildings (0%, 30% and 60% respectively for the three types). I interpreted this in PREDICTS nomenclature, based on descriptions of the locations in the article as well, as: Primary Forest (minimal), Primary Forest (intense) and Urban (minimal).\n\nSC1 29/1/2014 Added: Habitat has descibed in the source\nSC1 29/1/2014 Changed the sourse name from Horvath to Magura (who is the first author of the paper)\nSC1 29/1/2014 Added source for predominant habitat\nSC1 29/1/2014 Added habitat patch area\n\nSH1 27/05/2014 Checked urban sites for consistency with new definitions.  These sites are the same as those described in DB1_2007_Hornung.  Have checked forest description online and unlikely to be primary forest, so have changed classifications to match those of DB1_2007_Hornung - suburban and rural is Secondary indeterminate with Minimal use (previously Primary with Intense and Light respectively), urban is Urban with Minimal use (as previously).","SH curation:  changed Abundance metric type from 'Abundance' to 'Occurrence' as is presence/absence data 14.11.13\nSC1 29/1/2014 Added Fragmentation layout and Habitat as described in the source\nSH1 20.05.14 after discussion with TN, changed use intensity from minimal (for sites within A) and light (for sites within B) to all Intense.","The sites were split into 5 urbanisation categories. I interpreted these using the descriptions and google maps thusly:\n\nUZ1 -- urban intense\nUZ2 -- urban intense\nUZ3 -- urban light\nUZ4 -- urban minimal\nUZ5 -- young secondary forest\n\nI set zones 1-4 as well within the unfragmented habtiat type (i.e. all were well within the urban environment) and I set zone 5 as part of a fragmented landscape (consisting of suburbs and new growth forests on old crop and pasture land)\n\nSC1 25/2/2014 checked blocking design and it is correct, there are not block. Couldn't ad maximun linear extent but ad Habitat patch are equal to -1 (use -1 if patch area if unknown but large, extending far beyond the sampled area) as indicated in the guidelines as the samples are in the city of Beijing, China.\n\nSH1 21/05/2014 Changed sites categorised as Young secondary (sites 20-25) to Urban as still within the city (with minimal intensity as more greenspace around and appear to have been sampled within greenspace).  Those sites classified with Urban Minimal use (12-19) I have changed to Urban Light use as small green spaces within city.","15 locations where sampled at different time points: before, during and after construction. The sites were originally a disused orchard, habitat desgiantions were therefore: plantation (minimal), urban (intense) and urban (light)\n\nSC1 29/1/2014 Added Fragmentation layout\n\nSH1 22/05/2014 As orchard habitat had been abandoned 20y prior to the study and the site was 'successionally advanced', have changed 'Plantation' to 'Intermediate Secondary' wiht Minimal use.  The year of construction I have changed from 'Plantation' to 'Intermediate secondary' with Intense use.  Post construction the area is urbanised an samples from gardens, therefore remains 'Urban' with Light use.","Data came with urbanisation gradient scores: 0-1.6. I split this into three categories: 0 - 0.53, 0.53 - 1.07 and 1.07 - 1.6 (minimal, light and intense). I then put each site into one of these categories.\n\nI considered 'empty' shell as presence\n\nSC1 03/02/2014 Added Fragmentation layout and Source of predominant habitat\nSC1 03/02/2014 Added Maximum linear extent sampled\n\nSH curation:  changed Abundance Metric Type from 'Abundance' to 'Occurrence' as is presence/absence data 14.11.13\nSH1 27/01/14 looked at Predominant habitat classifications with regard to new landuse matrix.
